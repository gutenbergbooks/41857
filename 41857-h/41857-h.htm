<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>"I have considered the oppressions that are done
under the sun, and on the side of the oppressor
there is power."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the enforcement of the policy of Reconstruction
in the South, the evidences were from day to
day becoming so cumulative and decisive, that
nothing but the discipline of an enraged party,
coupled with the "spoils" principle, prevented
the whole mass of the community from a universal
expression of its desire to have it abandoned.
Reasoning men everywhere felt that it must continue
to multiply its mischiefs. "But," said its
authors, "treason must be made odious, and the
late insurrectionary States must feel that there is
a higher law than that promulgated by their ordinances
of secession."</p>

<p>The Spanish inquisition, now the abhorrence of
all enlightened minds, was long sustained in many
centuries by the tyrants' plea of necessity. In the
burning of a thousand heretics the religious zealot
saw the hand of God; in the destruction of a
thousand sorcerers, the fanatic discerned the commonweal
of the people; so in the whipcords with
which the people of the South were so mercilessly
scourged, there was found an antiseptic for the
gangrenous wounds inflicted by the civil war. All
these cruelties were legalized, while bleeding humanity
was sinking under the burden of oppression.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
In the collision of exasperated passions, it
is the temper of aggression that always strikes the
first blow. The government of the South by carpet-baggers
was essentially oppressive and inquisitorial.
It was, in its practical operation, a pure
and unadulterated despotism, superseding the protection
guaranteed by the Federal Constitution to
each and every State. It was under the dominion
of an organized anarchy, with legislatures and
courts of justice, subordinated to a lawless assemblage
of unprincipled men calling themselves the
representatives and judges of the people. Among
its necessarily implied powers was that of confiscation;
and numbered in its enumeration of brutalities,
was a nameless crime that shocked the moral
sense of mankind. Reconstruction came upon the
South with fearful impulse.</p>

<p>Perhaps the "hour is on the wing," when a worthier
hand will write the history of the institutional
age that was sandwiched between the slavery civilization
ante-dating the sixties, and that which
minimized the pernicious power of manhood suffrage
at the close of the century; or perhaps when
that remnant that still survives in the weakness of
age to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Weep o'er their wounds, o'er tales of sorrow done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shoulder their crutch and show how fields are won."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>shall have "passed over the river;" when the
threnody of the "olden days" which to us is
like the music of Carrol along the hills of Slimora,
"pleasant, but mournful to the soul," shall
be forgotten, some ambitious youth will uplift the
veil; will take a glance of the whole horizon, and
the south will unbosom her griefs that have been
so long concealed. It will not do for a hand that
drew the sword to guide the pen. By a law of our
nature all passive impressions impair our moral
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
sensibilities. Contact with misery renders us callous
to those experiences; a constant view of vice
lessens its deformity. If any expression in this
humble narrative shall appear ill-tempered, let me
say in the language of Themistocles at the battle
of Salamis, "Strike, but hear me." The whole
country has long since repudiated the dogma that
"all men are born free and equal" and endowed
with certain imprescriptible and inalienable rights.
This heresy of course found its highest expression
in the post-bellum amendments to the constitution,
and the remedial statutes which made their efficiency
complete. The war was the logical fulfillment
of prophecies that had their forecast in the
public councils before the nullification doctrine was
forced upon the Senate by Mr. Calhoun. It sprang
without extraneous aid from uninterpretable expressions
in the organic law, which were finally explained
away in the effusion of blood. Reconstruction,
in the conception of men who provided
the sinews of war, was the prolific aftermath; and
in this harvest field, the gleaners plied their vocation
with merciless activity, reinforced in their villainies
by the freedmen, who, in an experimental
way, were publicly evincing their unfitness for citizenship.
The Civil war gendered this brood that
filled the South with horror, and their disorders
and tumults precipitated a crisis that plunged the
Southland into a paroxysm from the Potomac to
the Rio Grande. There was no refuge from an
evil that was all-pervasive. The great war with
its pageants and sacrifices, its banners and generals,
its storming soldiery and reservoirs of human
blood was almost thrust out of the memory as the
patriots of the sixties stood face to face to the all-encompassing
perils of reconstruction. They saw
the flag of the Union&mdash;the almost lifeless emblem
of the genius of their liberties&mdash;frown feebly at the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
promulgation of a law that disfranchised 300,000
American citizens. The old banner seemed to turn
her eye to the eagle at her staff-head and ask him
to lend her his wide-spreading pinions, that she
might bend the wing and fly away from the polluted
spot&mdash;from the embodied forms of evil and
ruin. Almost every utterance of the complaining
tongue that was syllabled into speech, was to this
effect: "Will our country&mdash;our civilization&mdash;withstand
the shock?" Our Southern characters had
been enriched by an assemblage of all the treasures
which refined intellect could accumulate; we
had wisely built upon foundations of public virtue;
our institutions had the permanency of age
and respectability, and exhibited everywhere the
fullest maturity of athletic vigor. The paroles of
Southern soldiers amnestied them from arrest for
past military offences, but the clothing which their
poverty obliged them to wear marked the target at
which the lawless and vicious shot at their will.
Personal and State rights were abridged until nothing
was left of the sovereignty of the barren commonwealths
or the enthralled individual. There
were no juries of the vicinage but negroes; and
daily the broken-hearted people were unwittingly
aggrandizing rapacious officials. To the most depraved
of the negroes the carpet-baggers were constantly
appealing with arguments that stirred their
blood. This narrative will not in an historical
sense deal with the subject of reconstruction; from
its want of compactness and continuity it would
prove inefficient as a lesson or a guide. We present,
however, imperfect portraits of a few men
and women who were unfortunately in the pathway
of the storm that stripped the husbandman of
the fruits of his labor, the Southron of his liberty,
stifled the cries of the distressed, and rendered the
tenures of property unstable and insecure. In no
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
conjuncture in which this paroxysm of politics
placed the former masters of slaves, did they abate
their care and zeal for their betterment. Monuments
of brass and sculptured stone are not sufficiently
enduring to memorialize the virtues of the
negroes of the old plantations of the South, who
watched and waited for the avenging arm of Providence
to right the wrongs of old master. May
God's mercy rest and abide upon this scattered
remnant, that, like autumn's leaves in the forest,
have been blown hither and thither by the wraith
of the tempest.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

<h3>LOOKING BACKWARD.</h3>


<p>I have surrendered at discretion to vagrant
thoughts. Just as the idle school-boy will pause
beside the limpid stream to watch its eddying waters
as they go on and on, "never hasting, never resting,"
so I sit to-night in the haze of the years that
are dead, with the mind sadly reminiscent, and I
watch the shadows as they seem to sketch upon
the memory the familiar faces of our loved and
lost, and I hear their laughter and songs&mdash;grateful
echoes from the realm of the long ago. I am gazing
again upon the sepulchre of the old South, after
the plowshare of war and reconstruction had run
the last furrow. In the garnering of the red harvest
did our men and women of the sixties maintain
themselves with a proper decorum? Were
they less patriotic, less self-sacrificing, less ready
with heart and hand to divert the destructive revolution
of principle than their fathers of '76, who
in the upbuilding of republican institutions wavered
not in their purpose; when the terror and ignominy
of the scaffold were before them; when
they knew their blood must cement the foundations
of the structure they were rearing, and they themselves
become the first sacrifice in the temple of
liberty, which they were dedicating? In that epoch
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
and since we have been making the grand experiment
of self-government; not as Rome made it,
when liberty there was only a name for licentiousness;
not as Greece made it, when a demagogue
swayed the deluded masses and lacked only a
throne to make him a king; but with a constitution
that should deserve the encomium of the people,
for the unutterable blessings it should bestow; a
constitution impervious to unjust exactions and
unpatriotic suggestions, we hoped for a policy
dictated in a spirit of compromise; but as I
look back upon the eventful past, the first adventure
of Gil Blas occurs to me. He had been furnished
by his uncle with a sorry mule and thirty
or forty pistoles, and sent forth to seek his fortune.
He set out accordingly, but had not proceeded far
from home, when, sitting on his beast counting his
pistoles with much satisfaction, into his hat, the
mule suddenly raised its head and pricked up its
ears. Gil Blas looked around to see the cause of
its alarm, and perceived an old hat upon the ground
in the middle of the road, with a rosary of very
large beads in it. At the same time he heard a
voice addressing him in a very pathetic tone, "Good
traveler, in the name of the merciful God, and of
all the saints, do drop a few pistoles in the hat."
Looking in the direction from which these words
proceeded, he saw to his dismay the muzzle of a
blunderbuss projecting through the hedge, and
pointing directly at his head. Gil Blas, not much
pleased with the looks of the pious mendicant,
dropped a few pistoles in the hat and scampered
away as fast as he could. This slight narrative
presents to the mind of the writer the most perfect
emblem of the pacific remedy of reconstruction in
its beginning.</p>

<p>To the contemplative mind there is a melancholy
pleasure in looking backward; as shadows will enter
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
unbidden into the camera obscura, though every
portal appears securely guarded; so memories will
flit fantastically into the imagination when every
approach seems closed against intrusion. I am
looking backward, as it were, through a smoked
glass, for a great sunburst is within the radius of
vision, a sunburst that cheered our tired eyes with
its thousand scintillant gleams in the hot days of
August A. D. Nineteen Hundred.</p>

<p>Looking backward upon a picturesque civilization&mdash;upon
the old homesteads and plantations of
the South, with their hallowed associations and
ideals&mdash;with their impedimenta not of human chattels,
but of compact masses of freed slaves, the
underpinning of that civilization in its concrete
form.</p>

<p>I have asked the historian, the essayist, the
chronicler, the clairvoyant, to aid me in the retrospection,
but they answer dubiously. There is no
trodden path that I may pursue. No friendly
hand that I may clasp as I stride across fens and
brakes, and morasses: even the echoes of receding
footsteps, like the laughter of happy voices are
hushed and dead "lang syne." There are faded
letters however that I may read; broken swords
and battered shields hanging upon decaying walls;
moth eaten uniforms in garret and closet, that will
guide me backward. The line of vision is traversed
by unwieldy throngs of dilapidated men, in tattered
gray clothes, without a federal head, without
intelligent momentum, breaking up and dissolving
like icebergs drifting southward; they are
coming back home where there is neither grain for
the sickle, nor hope for the husbandman: coming
back to little cottages where lights in the windows
kept burning for dear papa flickered and spumed,
then died down into the rustic candlesticks,
when the little watchful eyes so tired and weary,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
closed upon the moonlight that shimmered within
the humble chamber.</p>

<p>Looking back over grave yards, where we reverently
laid away our jewels to be placed by the
Great Lapidary in His Crown by and by, when we
shall all rise from our sleep and shine in His emitted
glory. Looking backward over a strange realm,
without boundaries or capitals, where there are no
soldiers and no battle fields, and where every thing
is so fragrant and ethereal. Here we may fashion
pictures and weave around them gossamer draperies
as insubstantial as this golden twilight.</p>

<p>Hard-hitting, rough-riding moss-troopers rode
over the subjugated domains of the bewildered
South, with swords that flashed and turned every
way like Alaric's; rode hither to obliterate the past,
its monuments, its shrines, its traditions; to scarify
the old south with harrows and bayonets; its altars,
its homes, its civilization, and to fetter with chains
a great warlike people, with a purpose as fatuous
as ever animated the swart maid of Philistia.
Against this senseless vengeance, the South rebelled
again with the same old defiance, the same old
manhood. You may prod the wounded lion with
pikes and sabres, but you cannot tread upon it
with iron heels without hearing its roar and feeling
its fangs. To these marauders, the old South was
but a moor fowl to be plucked and eaten. To us
she was dynastic, like Hapsburg, Plantagenet or
Hohenzollern. To them the South was a huge incubator,
out of which was hatched "Stratagems
and treasons:" To us she was a Queen, still wearing
the purple, still grasping the sceptre, as in past
evolutions and crises. She was Our Queen when a
full century ago, and before there was a cabin upon
her plantations she pleaded for the emancipation
of slaves and was insultingly asked to withdraw
her petition by the Merchant Marine of Massachusetts.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
She was Our Queen when envenomed
abolitionists were gathering the aftermath of the
"Higher law proclamation;" she was Our Queen
when Ossawattomie Brown unleashed his bloodhounds
upon a fresher trail at Harper's Ferry; she
was Our Queen when Sumpter ran up a flag that
had never before fluttered in a gale, never before
greeted a young nation with its maiden blushes,
followed by the hopes, the prayers, the aspirations,
faith and loyalty of ten million men, women
and children; Our Queen when "old Traveler" was
stripped of his dust covered housings and led ever
so weary back into Old Mars. Bob's stables; Our
Queen when the last cavalier wiped the blood from
his sabre and scabbarded it forever. God grant
she may always be Our Queen that we may be her
liegemen, leal and right trusty in all catastrophes!
Hence we go back to think of her, to write of her,
though a widow bereaved of her husband, and a
mother who has buried her first born. There is no
sword now to gleam like a flash of light over the
plumes of charging squadrons: there is no guidon
to mark the line of direction through defile and
mountain pass: no call of the bugle "to saddle and
away," no thanksgiving like that of Jackson;
"God crowned our arms with Victory at McDowell
yesterday;" No smile like that of Lee as the Army
of the Potomac with trailing banners was double
quicking back to Washington. Ah! no, but the
old South through her blinding tears is smiling still;
her dear old face re-lighted by a fresher inspiration.</p>

<p>A trifling dash of time between 1860 and 1870,
but events have been packed away within that decade,
that would overlap the four corners of any
other century in the calendar. Within those years
were compounded somewhere in laboratories all the
combustible elements of war and pillage; the casting
the projectiles that would destroy a hemisphere.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Broken hearts&mdash;crushed hopes&mdash;desolated
homes, an enslaved country, wrongs, indignities,
outrages, oppressions, all, all wrought by the cruel
instrumentalities of great masters of tragedy. Here
is an old mansion with turrets and esplanades and
terraces long neglected and sadly out of repair.
Here are great oaks of a century's growth planted
and pruned by hands that have long since forgotten
their cunning. Here are lapping waters singing in
low sweet octaves as they did when poured out of
the hollow of His Hand. Here is the old rookery
out of which are ricochetting birds almost of every
voice and plume. Here are cattle, red and dappled,
cropping the meadow grass. Here are vast
expanses clad in the refreshing drapery of nature,
upheaving their grassy billows. Here are the crumbling
cabins of the old slaves, in silent platoons
that flank the old mansion, the earmarks of a picturesque
civilization abused and denounced. Slaves,
many of whom like the paintings of Titian and Murillo
and Correggio in the great mullioned halls have
come down from former generations. In yonder
clump of soughing pines stood the little meeting
house of the "cullud folks" on "Old Marsa's plantation."
Here for decades they worshipped. In
the little brook that glides along so cheerily singing
as it goes, they had baptized adult "bredrin and
sisterin." Here many of them had felt the touch of
the Master upon the emancipated souls, and heard
His voice in their spiritual uplifting, tenderly calling,
and there when the gnarled and knotted hands
had ceased their toil "Ole Marsa and Ole Misses"
had laid them crosswise upon rigid, lifeless bosoms,
that heaved not again with the pangs of suffering;
and out yonder under the maples, hard by the little
babbling brook, reverent and tender hands white
and black had lowered the rude coffin and covered
it up in "God's acre," and here around the little
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
altar ole Marster, and Miss Alice and Mars Harry
worshipped with them. No master, no mistress,
no slave in this consecrated ground; no black, no
white, in the invisible Presence; no hard times to
come again; no tithing men, nor tax gatherers; no
snarling, snapping wolf to snatch the gnawed bone
from the hungry wife and her starving child. If the
larder were empty the "great house" had an exhaustless
supply. If clothes were rent there was
"allus stuff in de loom;" If the clouds gathered for
snow "ole marsa" would put on his great coat and
knock at the doors and ask, "Boys, have you got
plenty of good wood for the storm'?" If Joshua
had the "rheumatics" or Melinda the "shaking
ager," or little Jeff the hives, there were ointments
and liquids, pills and lotions; and what physician
was so kind; whose hands so soft and tender,
whose voice so comforting and sympathetic as "ole
missis's and young missis's?" There was the garden
from which the negroes would market their vegetables;
there was the little "water million" patch
where little Jeff and Susan Ann would run out at
midday, and thump and thump and thump and
would as often run back with their mouths wide-open
like a rift in a black cloud, "Mammy, oh!
Mammy, dat great big water million is mo'est
ripe&mdash;be ripe by Sunday sho," and their little
black feet would knock off a jig on the bare floor;
then there was the pig sty where Sukey the "sassy
poker," in its sleekness and fatness, would
grunt and frisk and cavort all the day long. Then
there was "Ole Boatswain," the coon dog, lazily
napping in the door&mdash;barking at the treed coon in
his sleep; then there were the "tater ridges" and
the pumpkins and the cotton patches; then there
were the cackling hens and the pullets, the
ducks and geese and guinea-fowls; the eggs that
Hannah and Clarissa and Melinda had counted a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
score of times, and knew to a four pence a' penny
how much they would fetch in the town; and "dere
was de wagin wid ole Bob an' ole Pete wid pinted
yeares, chawin' de bit same as it were fodder, ready
to dash off fore dey wus ready;" and there were
the inventoried assets in trade, "free forfs Hanna's
and two forfs Melinda's and seben forfs Clarissy's,"
all tumbled in disorder, live stock and
dead stock. And then "dere was Melinda and
Judy a settin' a middle ships into de wagin, all
agwine to de town." And when the heavy wheels
would rattle with its human freight over the hard
ground of Ingleside, as the moon was dipping its
nether horn below the line of vision, and Clara
Bell and Melinda "a singin' de ole ship of Zion,"
"ole Marster an' Missis an' Miss Alice would run
outen de great house jes to see if Ned had fotched
us all back safe an' sound. An' den when Christmas
would come, de ole turkey gobbler would be
turnin' an' twistin' roun' and roun' fore de fire
drappin' gravy in de dish, and de barbeku would
be brownin' and de lasses a stewin out de taters in
great big ubbens, fo de flambergasted cookin' stobes
cum about to pester folkes. And den dere would
be ole Cæsar a shufflin' towards ole Marser's room,
and little Jeff a sneakin' on tip-toe to ketch ole
Marser's Christmas gift fore he seed em, an' Mary
an' Polly creepin' like cats in Miss Alice's chamber,
to get their stockins that Santy Claus had
stuffed from top to toe; and den de clatter in de
great dinin' room, when wid bowls of cream, and
flagons of mellow ole rye, Clarissa and Melindv
would be makin' egg-nog fur de fokeses, white and
cullud, on de plantation."</p>

<p>Oh! this golden prime!</p>

<p>There were no black soldiers in greasy uniforms
a hep, hep, hepping about the plantation; no firing
of guns by riotous negroes on the roadside; no
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
drunken, revelling wretches to slash and deface
portraits, walls and corridors; no lecherous villains
to accost and abuse defenceless and inoffensive
women; no vigils to keep for fear of murders,
burglaries and conflagrations; no angry forces and
energies to quicken and compound; no wife to say
to her husband, "Have you fotched any wittles
back from the conwenshun? 'Fore God de chillun
haint had narry moufful o' nuffin to eat dis blessed
day, nor me nuther."</p>

<p>Ah, no! the blessing that was vouchsafed unto
Israel, despite its rebellion, was all bountiful in
this land. "I will give thee peace in the land, and
ye shall lie down, and there shall be none to make
thee afraid."</p>

<p>Then war came with its unutterable horrors and
tumults. The old tallow candles were snuffed out,
and there were fears and alarms in the mansion and
the cabin; the thoroughbred was brought out of
the stable with yellow housings on, like the gelding
of a knight errant, and the young soldier, dressed
all in gray with buff revers, rushed out of the
house and vaulted into the saddle. There were
kisses and good byes&mdash;lost echoes now&mdash;as the cavalier,
young and happy and handsome, rode away.
Yes, rode away in the descending shadows, over
the hills, through the glades, to Manassas and to
death. Yes, rode away to the death wrestle&mdash;to
where the guns were spitting fire.</p>

<p>"Bress yo souls, fokeses," said Uncle Ned one
day, as he leaned upon his staff like a sheik
of the desert, "I looks back now und den, und
peers lak I kin see ole missis way back yander
in de war times, when de kannon was a plowin'
froo de trees ober at Manassy, same as a sho

All de day long pore old missis would walk up und

<p>To a paternal ancestor of Colonel John Walter
Seymour has been ascribed this prayer in battle,
"Oh Lord, thou knowest how busy I must be this
day. If I forget Thee, do not Thou forget me."
Then rising, he gave the command, "Forward,
march! On, my lads!"</p>

<p>At eight o'clock on the morning of the 23rd of
October, King Charles was riding along the ridge
of Edgehill, and looking down into the valley of
the Red Horse, a beautiful meadow, broken here
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and there by hedges and copses, he could see with
his glasses the parliamentary army as they marched
out of the town of Kleinton and aligned their
forces in battle array.</p>

<p>"I never saw the rebels in a body before," said
the king. "I will give them battle here." There
were hot words around the royal standard. Rupert,
a dashing young general, who had seen the swift,
fiery charges of the fierce troopers in the thirty
years war, was backed up by Patrick Lord Ruthven
and Sir Walter Seymour, among the many
Scots who had won renown under the great Augustus
Adolphus and opposed fiercely by Lord Lindsey,
an old comrade of the Earl of Essex, commander-in-chief
of the rebel forces, who swore by
all the saints in the calendar that he would not
serve again in an army under a boy, referring to
Prince Rupert, who was assigned by the king to
command the army at Edge Hill that day.</p>

<p>It was to this circumstance that the country was
indebted for the prayer aforesaid. The brave soldier,
unyielding in his loyalty to the king, resigned
his command as a general to command his company,
and in so doing gave affront to Lord Lindsay
and the king; but subsequently, at Scone, the king
said to him, "You shall accompany me to London
as a privy counsellor."</p>

<p>It was from this doughty ancestor of blessed
memory that John Walter Seymour lineally descended.
I have seen the old corselets, shackbolts,
shields and trefoils of that chivalric era that belonged
to the old baronet. Colonel Seymour had
interested himself greatly in the literature of that
institutional era that had so close a connection with
the pomp and power of the Feudal system.
He spoke learnedly too of the ideal purity of the
social and moral code of the age.</p>

<p>The Colonel himself was no ignoble scion of so
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
noble an ancestor. He had won his spurs and stars
at Malvern Hill, and at the disbanding of the army
he had covered the faded stars upon his collar with
his pocket handkerchief until unobserved he could
pluck them one by one and trample them underfoot.
His haughty spirit could not brook the shame
that overlaid him like a shroud when his sword
passed out of his hands hilt foremost at Appomattox.
He had taken the beautiful Alice Glendower
from a neighboring estate as his wife twenty-six
years ago, and now in the year 186-, though a shadow
darkening and deepening lay athwart heart and
home, the old man was still muttering curses long,
loud and deep. He had fully assimilated the indignant
spirit of Coriolanus. "I would they were
barbarians (as they are though in Rome littered),
not Romans as they are not though calved in the
porch of the capitol." His only surviving child Alice
was now in her twenty-third year. Harry, a princely
fellow, a young lieutenant of cavalry, had fallen
at the battle of Manassas and ever since that
day the mother had steadily declined until now the
end had almost come. The likeness of the dead
boy was photographed vividly upon her heart
and every tender chord was ceaselessly vibrating
from the presence of a grief, that recreated fancies
and memories that brought back to her the vanished
idol. God's peace had settled upon the old
home and its hearth stones, one beautiful Sabbath
morning, as the Colonel, his daughter and old Clarissa
had assembled in Mrs. Seymours's bed chamber.
The light of the morning sun shimmered
through open windows, and the shadows of the
tree boughs like imprisoned fairies danced in cotilion
upon the polished floor. "The birds are singing
so sweetly to-day," observed the sick lady.</p>

<p>"Yes indeed, they are," replied her husband.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said as she turned her face to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
him, "I have been greatly troubled by a horrid
dream."</p>

<p>"Land sakes alive ole missis," interrupted Clarissa,
"don't yu pester yoursef to def erbout dreams
these outlandish times. Dey is bad enuff goodness
nose widout dreaming dreams. Ned he jumped
clean outen de bed tother nite hollering for his ole
muskit lak he was agwine to war&mdash;his eyes fairly
a sot in his head lak a craw-fish and a tarryfying
me to def and hollering 'fire! fire!' and a foaming
at the mouf lak a mad dog, und duz yu know what
I dun ole missis? when dat drotted nigger hollered
fire! fire! I jes retched ober de table an' got de
pale of water an' I put out dat fire fore Ned skovered
whay hit war. Dat fool nigger walks perpendikler,
now yu heers my racket." She laughed
again and again as she continued: "And Ned he
wanted to fight; he was most drounded."</p>

<p>There was little of sentiment and less of diplomacy
in the character of Colonel Seymour; though
he was exceedingly tolerant toward Clarissa with
her little vagaries and superstitions. What the
dream of the good lady was has never been known&mdash;the
narrative was rudely broken off by the interruption
of Clarissa.</p>

<p>Would you know sweet Alice more intimately?  I
cannot portray her as she deserves; her heart was
like so many little cells into which were unceasingly
dropping the honey of blue thistle blossoms of
charity. In every den of wretchedness; in every
hovel where squalor and disease disputed all other
dominions, she was a beam of sunshine, giving
warmth and cheer and joy. The little star-eyed
daisies in the meadow would turn up their tiny faces
to greet her with smiles as she would pass them day
after day with the little basket upon her arm; God
had put her here among these poor people&mdash;among
the deluded negroes as his missionary, and I am
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
quite sure He was pleased with her work. I cannot
describe her beauty and grace of person better
than in the natural and characteristic language of
Clarissa "Miss Alice," she would say, "Yu is the
most butifullest white gal I ever seed in de wurrel;
yer cheek is jes lak mellow wine-sop apples, und
yer eyes is blu und bright lak agate marbles, und
yer teeth as white as de dribben snow, und when
yer laffs, pen pon it, even de birds in de trees stops
to lisen; und yu is jes as suple und spry as de clown
in de show."</p>

<p>Golden tresses like a nimbus of glory adorned
her queenly head. Eyes of blue graduated to the
softest tint; cheeks that transfered the deep blush
from tender spring blossoms. Something in her
there was that set you to thinking of those "strange
back-grounds of Raphael&mdash;that hectic and deep
brief twilight in which Southern suns fall asleep."
With Alice in her presence, Clarissa felt no evil;
when the storm came with blinding fire, its fierce
thunders, her refuge was by her side. She was her
inspiration, her providence. The gentle hand upon
the hot brow and there came relief; an old fashioned
lullaby from her sweet lips and the fevered
pickaninny in the cradle would turn upon his side
and fall into a grateful slumber. A prayer spoken
out of a heart touched by pity or sorrow, and instantly
another heart would be uplifted in thanksgiving.
She exercised too a power over the freed
slaves that made captive to her will almost all the
stubborn and rebellious negroes. Old Ned would
have plucked out his eyes for her and cast them at
her feet; so would Clarissa, so would Clarabel; so
would old Caesar and Hannah and Joshua. Only
these rebelled against her influence, to wit: Aleck,
Miles and Ephraim. Clarissa would say to her
young mistress so inquisitively, "Miss Alice, why
don't yu git married? Peers like child yer is too
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
sweet and pretty to live allus by yer lone, lorn self.
Yer aint allers gwine to be 'ticin an butiful like
yer is now. By and by de crow's foot is agwine to
cum into yer lubly face and dere is gwine to be
kurlikus and frowns in yo eyes jes lak yo mammy's;
she used to be pretty und lubly jes' lak you,
and whar is she now? De boys aint gwine to brak
their necks over you when yer gets ole an' ugly,
nuther. Now dey is lak a passel ov yallow jackets
a swarmin' a-roun my house, and axin me dis ting

sheepses und de cattle beastes? 'Taint agwine to
do nohow. Dat it aint. I kin count fourteen
portly yung 'uns dat wud jump clean akross de
crick fer yer any hour God sends."</p>

<p>Alice could only silently hearken to the force of
such plain, matter-of-fact reasoning, but poor girl,
there was not a single niche in her heart into which
she could lift an idol. Within the shrine there were
nothing but soulless effigies, so faded and old and
lifeless that they recalled only battle-fields and
sepulchres. "Will her prince never come, into
whose eyes she can see mirrored her own self, her
soul in its beauty, love and happiness?" Do you
ask? There is a medallion that hangs by a golden
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
chain across her fair bosom. "How long had she
worn it there," think you? Ever since</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<h3>OUR SCOTCH-IRISH.</h3>


<p>A person on entering the library in an old-fashioned
mansion, situated in the heart of a country
that was very beautiful in the landscaping of nature,
at eleven a. m. of the 12th of November,
would have observed a venerable gentleman reclining
upon an antique sofa, plainly upholstered in
morocco. The gentleman was reading from a book
entitled, "The Life and Speeches of Daniel Webster."
The stranger might have further observed,
that the right hand of the old gentleman would
now and again move with some energy of expression,
as if he were punctuating a particular paragraph
by an emphatic dissent. If the reader had
been asked for an opinion as to the character and
ability of the illustrious commoner, whose views
were so logically expressed in the memoir, he
would have said without hesitation, that "He possessed
the acumen of the wisest of statesmen, but
that his opinions as a strict constructionist were
extra hazardous, indeed out of harmony with the
true theory of a republican form of government&mdash;a
government of co-ordinate states that had entered
voluntarily into a compact for a more perfect
union. But (he may have continued) against the
doctrine of nullification, indeed against the ordinances
of secession, the irony of fate, through this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
great man, projected an argument whose logic was
irrefutable in its last analysis. Foreshadowed
events put into the mouth of Mr. Webster a menace,
whose uninterpretable meaning in 1833 was
clearly understood when the baleful power of the
storm swept from the high seas the last privateer
with its letter of marque, disbanded the last armed
scout south of the breakwater of the Delaware,
and broke the heart of the greatest warrior since
Charlemagne; a chieftain more honored in defeat
than Hannibal, or Napoleon, or Sobieski, or the great
Frederick. This master craftsman in the construction
corps of the Republic; whose resourceful intellect
engrafted a principle as fixed and inviolable
into the Constitution as fate, propelled against the
equity of 'peaceful separation' the weight of an
overmastering influence. This menace to the South
marked the tumultuous heart-beats of the commercial
North, when it contemplated the separation of
indestructible states. It made of the Republic
a huge camp of instruction, into which the nations
of the earth were perpetually dumping their refuse
populations; it girdled the South with a cincture
of embattled mercenaries; it imparted to the Constitution
a disciplinary vigor; it gave to partisan
legislation an inspiration; it gave to centralized
power an omnipotent reserve that unnerved every
arm, paralyzed every tongue, and rendered organized
effort abortive in the crucial struggle for
Southern independence. But, sir, (and the eyes of
the old man would gleam as with the light of an
overpowering genius), a government created by the
States, amendable by the States, preserved by the
States, may be annihilated by the States."</p>

<p>It was one of those leaky, bleak November days,
when the weather, out of temper with itself, is continually
making wry faces at the rain and the forest
and the cattle, that a gentleman lately arrived
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
from the auld town of Edinboro, shook the glistening
rain-drops from his shaggy talma in the great
hall of Ingleside, as he observed to the host with
a smile, "Thot it was a wee bit scrowie, but the
weether wad be fayre in its ain gude time." It
was indeed one of those leaden days that occasionally
comes in the Southland with the November
chills, pinching the herds that are out upon the
glades and meadows, when the winds sang in the
tree boughs with a strange and melancholy rhythm.
A sailor passing up the forward ladder from the
forecastle to observe the weather would say, with
a shudder, that it was a "greasy day," and that
the sky and shrouds and storm-sails were leaky.
Col. Seymour, upon ordinary occasions, was a gentleman
of discrimination, and his judgment of
character was fairly correct. Like the true Scotch
Southron, as he was, he had his own ideals, his own
loves and his own idiosyncrasies. He loved Scotland
and her people, her memories, her history,
her renown, her trossachs, her lakes, her mountains;
they were his people, and Scotland was the
"ain love of his fayther and mither." He had not
forgotten the language of her beautiful hills and
vales, though he was a boy when, with his parents,
he bade adieu to his bonny country to find a home
across the water in the Old North State, so prodigal
and impartial in the distribution of honors and
riches to all who came with clean hands and stout
hearts. So when the neat and genteel Scotchman
gave his name as Hugh McAden, the old man's
heart impulsively warmed towards his guest, for
he knew of a verity that a McAden everywhere was
a man of honor&mdash;the name, an open sesame to the
hearts and homes of Scotch Americans.</p>

<p>"I will make you very comfortable to-day, sir,"
he observed, as he escorted Mr. McAden to his
library. There were great hickory logs, half consumed,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
resting upon the antiquated brass andirons
in the fire-place, giving warmth and cheer to the
whole room. The stranger, rubbing his hands vigorously,
for they were very cold and stiff, observed
interrogatively, "You do not let the chill ond
weet coom into the hoose?"</p>

<p>"No indeed," replied the Colonel with a broad
smile, "these inflictions are for other folks, whose
liberty is upon the highways and in the forests in
such weather."</p>

<p>"Ah, for ither fauk; maybe the naygurs,"
laughingly suggested the Scotchman.</p>

<p>"Yes, you can hear the guns in the woods, where
they are hunting cattle not their own. You can
see drunken squads marching upon the roads upon
such a day."</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, "ond do ye call this free
America? May-be ye hae no goovernment as ye
haed lang syne, ond no law ither."</p>

<p>The Colonel assured the gentleman that public
affairs were at sixes and sevens, and the negroes
now held the mastery over their former owners,
and their discipline was not over indulgent.</p>

<p>"Ond do the naygurs make the laws for sic as
you?" he enquired in a startled way.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," replied the Colonel, quite seriously.</p>

<p>"Alack-a-day!" exclaimed the astonished man.
"The deil take sic a goovernment, ond the deil tak
sic a coontry, ond the deil tak the naygurs! Coom
to Edinboro, mon, where there is not o'ermuch siller,
but where ivery mon is his ain laird, ond his
hoose is his ain hame. Ye ken fine that I am a
stranger hereaboot. Ond will the naygurs harm a
poor mishanalled mon like me?" he enquired in
alarm. The Colonel, with an effort to conceal his
mirth, reassured his friend that no harm would
come to him.</p>

<p>"Ond wad ye say," the Scotchman interrupted,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
"that amang the naygurs ond sic a government,
that a puir body wad hae the protection o' his ain
queen?" he again asked, with his fears still unsubdued.
The amiable host, shaking from an effort at
self-control, again remarked that the carpet-bag
government had made no attempt at personal violence
upon strangers, and that he was as safe here
as in his own city of Edinboro; and the Scotchman
laughed away his fears.</p>

<p>"Sic an auld fule!" he exclaimed in great glee.
"I am hardly masel in these lowlands," the Scotchman
continued, as the conversation changed into
more agreeable channels. "Ye hae na moontains
ond bonnie hills hereaboot," he continued, as he
looked from the window upon the low-lying fields
and meadows.</p>

<p>"But, my friend," replied the Colonel, "if you
will abide with me for awhile you will quite forget
your mountains, for there is a charm and freshness
in the landscape here when you become familiar
with it."</p>

<p>"I am sure of thot," quickly answered the guest;
"but ye ken fine that a puir body must abide in
his ain hame. What wad a man do in th' Soothland
wi' his beezeness in Edinboro?" And the
Scotchman smiled as he asked the unanswerable
question. "Ah, well," the Colonel replied with
an assumed dignity, "you would do as we do."</p>

<p>"Ond what is thot?" asked the Scotchman.</p>

<p>"Swear and vapor from early morn to dewy eve."</p>

<p>"Ah! thot wad na do, thot wad na do," he replied,
horrified at such a suggestion, "The meenister
in holy kirk wad discipline a puir body, ond
the deil wad be to play. I guess I'll gang hame
agen ond do as ilka fauk do in th' auld toon."</p>

<p>The Colonel had not been so happy in many a
day as with the plain, matter-of-fact Scotchman,
in a sense, a type and representative of his own
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
people, and a man who could speak so eloquently
of the fadeless glory of old Scotland.</p>

<p>"Hae ye nae gude wife ond bairns?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, an invalid wife and an only child, sir,"
said the Colonel, as tears began to gather in his
eyes. "My only son, sir, was slain in battle some
years ago."</p>

<p>"Ond was it for sic a goovernment as ye hae noo,
that ye gaed up your bonnie lad to dee?" he asked
quite innocently.</p>

<p>The old man bowed his head in silent grief. He
could not answer, and he walked across the room
and looked out upon the murky sky&mdash;a funereal
coverlid, it appeared, laid over the grave of poor
Harry.</p>

<p>"Puir lad," uttered Mr. McAden, half aside, as
he drew his handkerchief across his face and gazed
abstractedly into the blazing fire. It was quite an
interval before the Colonel was able to subdue this
paroxysm of grief that had quite overcome him,
and, availing himself of the earliest opportunity
to excuse himself, withdrew from the room. To Mr.
McAden the moment was fraught with sincere sorrow.
He had unwittingly opened the sluice-way at
the veteran's heart, and great tides, crimsoned, as it
seemed, with the blood of poor Harry, were pouring
into it. He could find no surcease only in the
oft-repeated exclamation of reproach.</p>

<p>"Sic an auld fule! Sic an auld fule! But I
thocht the mon was o'er happy in the love of his
gude wife ond the bairn. Haed I thocht thot
the lad had deed in battle, I wad na gaed him sic
a sair thrust in his auld heart."</p>

<p>The Colonel retired to his own chamber to repair
the injury that had been done to his feelings, and
presently he returned with a smiling face, accompanied
by his daughter, and he said, introducing
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"This sir, is my daughter, Alice."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Mr. McAden, rising with extended
hand, "The lassie is like the sire, Coonel.
I can see the fayther in her een."</p>

<p>"And the counterpart of her mither in all except
the een," replied her father.</p>

<p>"You ond the gude wife ond the lassie must
coom to Edinboro, Coonel; ye ken fine thot her
rooyal men ond weemen are i' th' groond noo, ond
there are memorials here ond there in the auld
kirk-yards where their puir bodies are laid, but
our men ond weemen still are vera fayre ond gentle,
ond we niver put our een upon a naygur. Ond,
now thot I can abide nae langer wi' ye, will ye nae
tell me a wee bit o' the history o' our ain fauk in
the Soothland, for ye ken fine thot the auld anes
wad be askin aboot this ane ond thot ane, in fine
all aboot the Scotch in your ain coontry, when I
gae hame to Edinboro."</p>

<p>The subject referred to by the Scotchman was
full of a picturesque interest, and no man in the
Southland took a higher delight in imparting such
information as he could command, than Colonel
Seymour. Turning his old arm-chair so that he
could observe his guest more closely, he began:</p>

<p>"The characteristics of these people are ineffaceably
impressed upon our civilization. Indeed they
are as deeply grounded into the religious and
social soil of North Carolina, as though they had
taken root like the rhododendron under the rocks
and in the fissures of our hills and mountains.
The Scotch-Irish American, with gigantic strides,
has at last sat himself down upon the loftiest pinnacle
of our 19th century civilization. He has never
yielded to oppression; he has never compounded
with evil. These brave people, bringing hither the
virtues of their fathers as well as their own, have
given North Carolina its most luminous page. They
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
made the earliest industry of the Cape Fear&mdash;the
industry of colonization. It was an industry that
sought to provide homes for the people, and to dignify
labor and life in the midst of surroundings
that taxed every resource of action, and the ultimate
verge of human daring; an industry that employed
the plainest instruments&mdash;the axe to hew
down the forest, and the plow to turn the furrow.
Their primitive sires in these early settlements did
not control those powerful auxiliaries that now
multiply the skill of man; nor did they enjoy the
aristocracy of the recognized power of wealth.
They cared nothing for mammonism, that some
philosophical crank has defined to be a physical
force that makes men invertebrates. Here was life
with the struggle of pioneers; a struggle for place
rather than for position; for homes rather than
castles, that prepared the intellect for a higher development,
and man for ultimate power. The victory
of the axe and plow were the pre-ordained antecedents
to the victory of the forum and pulpit,
and the triumph over the crude obstructions of nature
was the divine prophecy of undisciplined toil.
Out of the ruggedness of such an epoch came forth
a condition of virtue and integrity; of honest and
honorable convictions; of sincere patriotism; of a
race of men who looked to themselves only, and
originated within this scant domain the literature
of economic life. It was here that the domestic
sentiment displayed its captivating charm. Nowhere
on earth was there a more generous love for
children, and whenever this attribute of the heart
appears, the prophetic benediction of Christ, as
childhood lay in His hallowed arms, is fulfilled.
Here was social life, too, in its freedom, picturesqueness
and animation, without demoralizing
conditions. Away northward and southward, bays
and rivers stretched their wedded waves, hills holding
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
in their dead grasp the secrets of centuries; the
ancient miracles of fire and water where chaos had
been transfixed in its primeval heavings; all these
were here subject to the mighty mastery that men
should eventually exert, and side by side with
humble homes, arose schools and churches&mdash;emblems
of the power and purity of the people. Here
the ambassadors of Christ were persuasive with
tongue, fervent in spirit; they felt that their religion
was more ancient than government, higher
than any influence; more sacred than any trust;
a religion that was benevolence in its gentlest mood,
courage in its boldest daring, affection in its intensest
power; philanthropy in its widest reach;
patriotism in its most impassioned vigor; reason
in its broadest display; the mighty heart that
throbbed through every artery; fed every muscle;
sped the hidden springs of an electric current
through every nerve. Such were and are "oor ain
fauk in th' Soothland."</p>

<p>"Ah, I ken fine," replied the Scotchman with
enthusiasm, "that your forebears came from the
hielands, and yoor knowledge of the gude fauk in
yoor ain coontry quite surprises me. Did ye not
say that yoor fayther ond mither came from Edinboro?"
he inquired with animation.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Colonel, "in the good old
days; and they lie buried side by side in the little
cemetery over the hill yonder, where I shall rest
after a wee bit."</p>

<p>"These are bonnie lands hereaboot, but there is
mony a glade in auld Scotland where a puir body
may sleep as tranquilly," said the Scotchman with
feeling, "ond when I dee my sepulchre shall be
near the auld hame where there are no naygurs
ond no sic a goovernment, in th' shadow o' th' auld
kirk o' my fayther ond mither."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<h3>THE ASSASSINS OF THE PEACE OF THE SOUTH. </h3>


<p>To the people of the South the infliction of the
carpet-bag government was an outrage that "smelled
to heaven." The changed character&mdash;the degradation
of the South was a deplorable consequence&mdash;it
was the inoculating of a virus into the
circulation of the body politic that it will take a
century to cleanse.</p>

<p>The power of attainting and confiscating, forbidden
by the law from a full knowledge of its lamentable
use by the factious parliaments of Great
Britain, was shamelessly exercised by local jurisdictions
of the South until nothing was left to the
most virtuous of patriots but their name, their
character, and the fragrance of their great and
illustrious actions, to go down to posterity. A
stranger coming to any legislature would have
taken it at one time for a disorderly club-room,
where ignorant and vicious partisans, white and
black, were assembled to lay plans for their own
aggrandizement and the prostration of the country.
At another time he would suppose it to be a
hustings for the delivery of electioneering harangues;
at another, an areopagus for the condemnation
of all virtuous men; then a theatre, for the
entertainment of a most diverted auditory; always
a laboratory for the compounding of alarms,
conspiracies and panics. In the deliberations
of the members there was no check to the
license of debate, or the prodigal expenditure of
money; no voice to control their judgments of outlawry
and sequestration. Radamanthus himself,
in some stage of his infernal process, would at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
least listen to his victim; "First he punisheth,
then he listeneth, and lastly he compelleth to confess."
The inventors of mythology could not conceive
of a Tartarus so regardless of the forms of
justice as not to allow the souls of the condemned
to speak for themselves; but reconstruction, trampling
upon all laws, denied to the long-suffering
people of the South the right to plead their innocence
in the face of the concentrated accumulation
of frightful accusations,all founded upon the "baseless
fabric of a vision."</p>

<p>Centuries ago the last saurian died in the ooze of
the bad lands in Kansas, but by an unnatural law
of reproduction the carpet bagger and scalawag,
with the same destructive instincts, with the same
malodorous presence, found its bed of slime in the
heart of the South and disported with a devilish
energy. Monsters of malice, spawning evil gendering
fanaticism, focussed their evil eye upon the
millions of freedmen, whose destiny and happiness
were closely interwoven with their old masters;
with masters who had yielded their swords but not
their honor; who were "discouraged, yet erect; perplexed,
yet not unto despair; pursued, yet not forsaken;
smitten down, yet not conquered." The
poor negro, under the seductive charms of these
human serpents, languished, and languishing, did
die.</p>

<p>The carpet-baggers preached to the negroes an
anti-slavery God, from the gospel of hate, of revenge.
Slavery was the tempest of their poor
souls, and revenge must assuage the swollen floods.
"The thronged cities&mdash;the marks of Southern prosperity
and the monuments of Southern civilization,"
said they, "are yours, yours to enjoy, to alienate,
to transmit to posterity. Your empire is established
indestructibly throughout the new South.
This land shall not be permitted to remain as a lair
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
for the wild beasts that have clutched at the throat
of this republic to destroy it. We have heard
the cries of our Israel in bondage, and we have
come to give you the land that flows with milk and
honey." Poor black souls! What a delusion! The
day will surely come when the curtain shall be
drawn and the deceivers, active and dormant, in
this dark tragedy, shall be dragged before the footlights
to receive the curse of an indignant reprobation.
Poor negro! He is starving for bread and
they give him the elective franchise. He begs to be
emancipated from hunger, and they decree that he
shall be a freedman.</p>

<p>Who will dare assert that the pride, the patriotism,
the spirit of the South was not alarmingly
compromised by the issues of the Civil War?&mdash;a
war that was the exercise of both violence and discipline
by sovereign authority. We are told that
wars are an evil, come when they may; they are
just or unjust, moral or immoral, civilized or savage,
as the ingredients of violated rights&mdash;demand
of reparation and refusal&mdash;shall be observed, neglected
or abused. Perhaps the prostrated South
should have been advertent to this fact before she
delivered the first blow. But whether right or
wrong, when the armies were disbanded, when it
yielded its organic being&mdash;its sovereignty&mdash;to overwhelming
resources and numbers, the law of nations
laid upon the paramount sovereignty obligations
which have never been performed, either in
letter or spirit. The government that re-instated
its authority was bound by a circle of morals, including
the obligations of justice and mercy, reciprocally
acting and reacting.</p>

<p>The emancipation of five million slaves was a
supplemental act of war; a renewed declaration
that the tramp of embattled armies should echo
and re-echo from the Potomac to the Rio Grande,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
until the foot of a slave should not press its "polluted"
soil. Their enfranchisement was neither an
act of war or of exasperation, but an act of diplomacy,
extra-hazardous as results have shown, with
the effect of humiliating the conquered South. It
introduced throughout the South a sacrilegious
arm against the fairest superstructure of Christian
manhood the world has ever known; stamped the
history of the nation with dishonor, and betrayed
the proudest experiment in favor of the rights of
man. It taught the freedmen, through the vicious
counsel of intriguing, designing demagogues, that
their liberty was still insecure; that to accomplish
it in its ultimate triumph and blessing, the savage
axe must be laid at the root of the social institutions;
that they must lay violent hands upon the
men, women and children who had made their
emancipation an accomplished fact. Hence a war
whose horrors should be accentuated by the lighted
torch was inaugurated, and an inglorious campaign
of reprisals by placable tools, whose zeal to preserve
what they now purposed in their blind fanaticism
to destroy, was a few years before as ardent and
persevering.</p>

<p>Poor, pitiable, deluded human beings, who as
chattels real&mdash;impedimenta of Southern plantations&mdash;had
guarded the peace of the home, and
many of whom were faithful unto death!</p>

<p>Reconstruction superimposed an artificial citizenship&mdash;a
citizenship essentially lacking in every
resource of intellectual strength&mdash;it was without
ideals or examples for the government of the freedmen
of the proud Southern commonwealths. The
allegiance of the negroes was as friable as a rope
of sand; they were without a definite conception of
the responsibilities of sovereignty&mdash;without a fixed
principle to guide them in governmental policy&mdash;with
impulses of brutish suggestion, and under
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
masters more inexorable, more exacting than those
they had deserted upon the abandoned plantations.
How painful was such a crisis that split up the old
South into disgraced and bleeding fragments!</p>

<p>We come to speak for a moment of the microbes
that ate their way into the hearts of the seceded
commonwealths, while the ruins of southern homes
were still smoking; and before the blood of chivalrous
southrons had dried upon our battle-fields. I
commend the chalice to the lips of those who will
deny the truth of what is herein written and desire
that such a man might realize a bare modicum
of what was suffered and endured. The elective
franchise was the panacea for every evil; an antispasmodic,
when there were occasional exacerbations
in the public mind; our fathers valued the
elective franchise because in its patriotic expression
was the covenant of freemen.</p>

<p>When our hopes were feeblest, and our horizon
darkest, the scalawag fled like a hound to the sheltering
woods whence he sallied forth like an outlaw.
The reddened disc of the sun that went down
at Appomattox gave him an inspiration for his hellish
work, and he went out in the gloom of the starless
night, declaring with a more vicious temper
than did Henry of Agincourt "the fewer the men
the greater the honor" or in its appropriate paraphrase
"the deeper the pockets the greater the
spoil." His philanthropy and selfish interests
never clash. He claimed always to be rigidly
righteous, and was seen in the camp-meeting and
the church sanctified and demure to a proverb.
He spoke of the poor negro in paroxysms of charity&mdash;a
most rare benevolence which employed its
means in theft and crime; a charity which performs
its vows and gives its alms with money plundered
from the freedmen. The scalawag like other unclassified
vermin was without respectable antecedents;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
with an acute sense of smell like the "lap-heavy"
scout of the Andes, he sought his prey when
there was no fear of the approach of man. As an
Irish barrister once wrote upon the door of a plebians'
carriage, "Why do you laugh?" so the humorist
of the sixties could have written upon the
shirt-front of the scalawag "Why do people hold
their noses?" He was never mentioned by naturalists,
unless under some other name he was paired
off with the vulture. In reconstruction days the
transformation of this abortion of nature from vulture
to serpent was made without the break of a
feather or the splitting of a talon. With a seductive
grimace he whispered into the open ear of the
freedmen "In the day that thou eatest thereof
thou shalt not surely die." He was as much an
augury of evil as the brood of ravens that once
alighted upon Vespasian's pillar. Had he been
seen plying his vocation in the first empire Napoleon
would have said to Fouche, "Shoot the accursed
beast on the spot." The carpet bagger when
not fighting the pestiferous vermin in the Chickahominy
swamps was pilfering. He went into the
army conscripted like a gentleman; he came out of
the army at night when the back of the sentry was
turned and without a furlough, like a patriot.
These twain were the autocrats of the new south,
which had its christening in the blood of heroes;
they were the furies that rode the red harlot around
the circle, when her flanks were still wet with human
slaughter, and her speed was increased by
the jeering negroes. When Sister Charity in an
occasional fit would fall unconsciously into the receptive
bosom of her black lover in the prayer-meeting,
with the wild exclamation "Bress Gord I
sees de hosses und de charyut er cumin!" they
would clap their hands in joy and shout, "Persevere
in the good cause my sister." When old deacon
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Johnson upon some happy suggestion from the
"sliding elder" would turn up the white of one
eye, they would turn up the whites of the others;
and when deacon Thompson came around for alms
for the heathen, they would slip under the pennies
a brass-button and inwardly thank God they
were not like the poor publican or the hypocritical
pharisee. Their first meeting with the freedmen
was flattering and agreeable; it was an expression
of frail vows of love, sweet but not permanent,
which bore but the perfume and dalliance of a moment;
it was the fusing of units of power for the
purpose of spoil, and plunder. Sambo had prayed
ardently for this revelation, and it had come. The
scalawag, carpet-bagger, and freedman were parties
of the first part, second part and third part
in the tripartite agreement, until the negro became
the party of no part or the worst part, and he began
to mutter to himself in vulgar doggerel:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ort is er ort und figger is er figger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All fur de white man und none fur de nigger."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When Sambo stole from the store to increase the
joint stock-in-trade, the plunder was checked off in
the invoice and Sambo was checked off in the penitentiary;
if the firm went into liquidation it was
because its active and suffering partner went into
jail. If the poor negro died with assets the carpet-bagger
"sot upon de state" like a carrion-crow
upon a putrid body. These human harpies were
natural sons of the commune.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The dirty co-partners opened up business in the
south, as soon as Sherman's army had crossed the
border, under the attractive firm name and style of
"The Devil broke loose in Dixie." The iron-hoof
of war had so cruelly scathed the bosom of the
south that it was like an overripe carbuncle; it required
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
a little scarifying and savage hands might
squeeze and sponge at will.</p>

<p>Credit was prostrate; society was disorganized,
treasuries empty; debt like a huge fragment of ice
slipping away from the glacier upon the mountain,
was gathering volume and momentum as it rolled
on and on, and the poor old tottering, reeling country
was still struggling on like a bewildered traveller,
followed by wolves, and overshadowed by vultures.
Corruption and ignorance were the only
passports to power. No modern instance of wrong
and oppression can approach this Fructidor of the
sixties in the South. Human ghouls not so black
as these vomited out, the Carbonari of Italy, the
Free Companions of France and the Moss Troopers
of England.</p>

<p>This condition of things, we dare assert, is without
a parallel in the history of any people, in any
civilization. Even when Rome was swayed by the
keenest lust for conquest and dominion, their legions
conquered the barbaric states, not to degrade
or destroy, but to attach them to her invincible
arms. Savage vengeance never went so far as to
place the slave above the master by way of retribution.
This was the exciting cause that brought
into fullest display the natural law of reprisals
and retaliations upon the part of the Southern people.</p>

<p>The first prominent cause of public disturbance
of which the carpet-baggers were the authors was
a most thorough and secret organization of the negroes
in all the counties into Loyal Leagues; in
many instances armed and adopting all the formula
of signs, pass-words and grips of an oath bound
secret organization. When the negro is asked why
he votes the Republican ticket his simple answer
always is, "Why Lor bress your soul Marsa,
we swo to do dat in de League." That simple answer
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
by this new suffragist, this new automaton of
the ballot, is a full explanation of the political solidity
of the negro vote: With such an element to
work upon, ignorant and degraded, the carpet-baggers,
fierce and rapacious, have found themselves
in Mahomet's seventh heaven in the South.</p>

<p>It is a subject of interest and maybe of admonition
to the people North and South, how political
institutions, in an age of the highest civilization
and under the most explicit constitutional
forms, may be changed or abolished by a process of
partisan policy, when inaugurated in a spirit of
hate, revenge or avarice. Pseudo-philanthropists
may talk never so eloquently about an "equality
before the law" when equality is not found in the
great natural law of race ordained by the Creator.
That cannot be changed by statute which has been
irrevocably fixed by the fiat of the Almighty. The
result of this mongrel combination of carpet-bagger,
scalawag and negro; this composition of
vice and ignorance and rapacity, was plainly seen
everywhere. Robbery and public plunder were
rampant in the State capital. The expenses of government
were at once increased five hundred per
cent. Verily the pregnant suggestion of the carpet-bagger
that the only way to bring down the
white people of the South to the level of the negro
was to tax them down, was carried out with a sweeping
vengeance. These thieves and robbers, who
had fastened themselves like vampires upon the
public treasury, and unlike the leach, did not let
go their hold when full, were still gorging themselves
by new methods of plunder. No such rate
of taxation upon the same basis of property valuation
has ever occurred in the history of the world.
A tithe of this rate of taxation lost to the crown
of England her thirteen American colonies. All
the county auditors, county treasurers, trial
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
justices in the courts of record were utterly incompetent
and utterly corrupt. The juries in the
courts of records were mostly negroes, summoned
by negro sheriffs, and the pardoning power in the
hands of venal and truculent governors was shamefully
prostituted. The most unblushing villainies
and crimes were either officially condoned or remitted
and forgiven.</p>

<p>The people were taxed by millions; millions were
paid out, and no vouchers were ever taken or found.</p>

<p>In the face of such universal misrule, speculation
and tyranny, there could be no greater misrepresentation
of the truth than is contained in the oft-reiterated
accusation, that the white people of the
South are fierce, aggressive and defiant in their
conduct towards those placed in authority over
them by the Federal or State law. Aggressive and
defiant! How vain and worse than useless would
such conduct be against the overwhelming power
of the tyrants who oppose them. It is against all
the instincts of life, when despair has taken the
place of hope.</p>

<p>Defiant? Does the poor unresisting hare, when
trembling with frenzied apprehension under the
feet and wide open jaws of the hound exhibit much
defiance, or much hope of victory in a death struggle
with its cruel and merciless foe? It makes no
resistance&mdash;no motion or attitude of battle for life
except that involuntary and spasmodic action produced
by pain and suffering.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<h3>TYPES AND SHADOWS.</h3>


<p>The development of the negro, educationally,
has been embarrassed by natural causes that he
has been unable to overcome. In a great variety
of instances he has failed to be actuated by an intellectual
or benevolent reason. In the evolution
of the negro from a savage to a slave, from a slave
to a freedman, and from a freedman to a citizen,
only in exceptional instances has he been able to
originate a theory or experiment that has been
profitable to himself or others. No high state of
civilization has ever originated from them. History
teaches us that a nation may pass through an ascending
or descending career. It may, by long-continued
discipline, exhibit a general, mental advance;
or it may go through other demoralizing
processes, until it descends to the very bottom of
animal existence.</p>

<p>Man is distributed throughout the earth in various
conditions: in temperate zones he presents the
civilization of Europe and America; in torrid zones
the ignorance and nakedness of the African. It
was out of the stewpan of the equator that the
negro was fished&mdash;with all the features and instincts
of a barbarism, from which he is slowly emerging&mdash;by
cruel and irresponsible traders. The religious
ideals of the negro are vague and indeterminate.
They are intensely superstitious, and believe, as
their ancestors before them, in sorcery and witchcraft.
Although their powers of origination are
inefficient, they readily imitate the manners, customs
and idiosyncracies of their masters, and frequently
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
exhibit a superficial polish. They are emotional
rather than practical in their religion. They
are not naturally revengeful or vindictive, and
they have shown a sentiment of gratitude that
greatly endeared them to their owners. When war
was flagrant, and they felt that it was waged for
their emancipation&mdash;that the institution of slavery
was menaced by Federal arms, in unnumbered instances
they held in sacred trust millions of dollars
worth of property and the lives of thousands of
defenseless human beings, who held over them,
without challenge, the rod of domestic government.</p>

<p>Under all exasperating causes up to and during
the war, hundreds of slaves remained loyal to the
interests and authority of their masters.</p>

<p>Conditions, however, highly inflammatory, developed
passions that made them brutish, dishonest
and cruel. Their emotional religion and their
prejudices acted concurrently. The carpet-bagger
found these unlighted fagots distributed everywhere
throughout the South; he had only to entice
them by delusive promises; he had only to say
to them, "Will you be slaves, or freedmen?"&mdash;to
put into their hands a new commission, and into
their hearts a new faith, differentiated from the
old in order to kindle the fires of hate and revenge.</p>

<p>The Freedman's Bureau in the South was the
nineteenth century Apocalypse&mdash;a revelation truly
to the poor negroes, who had devoutly longed for
its coming. The event, they thought, would be
distinguished by their sudden enrichment; its huge
commissariat would leak from every pore with the
oil of fatness; officials, patient and sympathetic,
would stand at its portals to distribute pensions
and subsistence, and the star-spangled banner waving
from the masthead would bow its welcome to
all who came. Something for nothing was their
great law of reciprocity. Four million slaves fastened
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
themselves like barnacles upon this odious
institution, an extremely partisan agency, deadly
and inimical&mdash;hostile to the peace of the South
and the interests of her people. These slaves, maddened
by their misery, looked back upon the ruined
plantations, and laughed when they felt that
the whirlwind of retribution had swept over the
land.</p>

<p>Aleck, a former slave of Colonel Seymour, but
whose rebellion to the slightest authority had latterly
been shown by expressions cruel and insulting,
and who affected a social equality with the
carpet-baggers, halloed over the picket fence in the
small hours of the night, to Johua, who was now
eighty years of age:</p>

<p>"Hay, dar, yu franksized woter! hez yu heerd
de news, ur is yu pine plank ceasded? Hay, dar,
Joshaway! De bero man is dun und riv wid de
munny, und he lows dat he is ergwine ter penshun
off de ole isshu niggers fust."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye!" exclaimed Joshua, almost mechanically,
as he aroused himself with an effort, and
rubbed the sleep out of his dimmed eyes, "Don't
you heer dat, Hanner?" he asked his old wife.
"Ergwine to penshun off de ole isshu niggers fust!
Grate Jarryko! Who dat er woicin' dat hebbenly
pocklermashun outen dar in de shank o' de night?
Haint dat yu, brudder Wiggins?"</p>

<p>"Yaw," Aleck replied, "dis is me, sho. De bero
man hez dun und sont me to norate dis pocklermashun
to you und Ned."</p>

<p>"Grate Jarryko!" exclaimed Joshua, again excitedly.
"Hanner," he continued, "ef yu ever seed a
cricket hop spry 'pon de hath, jess watch dis heer
ole isshu jump inter his gyarments."</p>

<p>As the negro was groping about in the dark for
his ragged clothes he said half parenthetically,
"Dat dare voice fetches to my membrunce de scriptur
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
agen, whay hit says "Fling yo bred into de
warter und hit is ergwine to cum out a ho cake."
Yu is er shoutin', sliding-baccurd mefodis Hanner
und don't pin yo fafe to providence but to grace,
und grace is ergwine to keep you perpendikkler in
Filadelfy meeting-house, but hit haint ergwine to
fetch no horg meat nur taters nudder, dis side of
de crick. Hit wur providence dat fotched dat bero
man into de souf-land wid de munny to de ole lams
of de flock. Don't yu see?"</p>

<p>"I sez ole lams," snapped Hannah; "ef day wuz
de onliest wuns gwine to be penshunned off, yu'd
be stark nekked as er buzzard, kase yu is dun un
backslewed wusser dan a scaly horg."</p>

<p>"Grate Jarryko!" ejaculated Joshua, "How's a
mishunnary ergwine to back slew, tell me dat?
Kase you jined Filadelfy church, you haint
got all de liggion in de world. Dare's Zion
und dare's Massedony und dare's de baptizin crick
und den dares fafe und providence. Don't you
see Hannah? I'm ergwine to ax yu enudder pint
rite dare," continued Joshua. "Who dat way
back yander in the dissart, dat de good Lord fed
wid ravens, when de rashuns gin out? Pend upon it,
dat woice out yander imitates de woice of the proffit
Heckerlijer, dat flung his leg outen jint, er tusselling
wid de harkangel."</p>

<p>"Twant Heckerlijer" answered Hannah sharply,
as she threw a splinter of lightwood upon the embers.
"Yu's allus a mysterfying de scriptures when
yu's er spashiatin erbout dem proffets; yu haint
never heerd no such a passage as dat from de circus
rider, nur de slidin elder nudder; ef dat cum
outer de scriptur, hits by und 'twixt de misshunaries,
und day is fell frum grace same as yu."</p>

<p>"Now yu's acting scornful agen de misshunarys"
replied Joshua contemptuously, "Ef you ever gits
to hebben, let me pete dat ergin; I sez, ef you ever
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
gets to hebben yu's ergwine to hole a argyment
wid de possel Joner, und den yu's ergwine to be
flung outen de gate."</p>

<p>"Whay did yu get dat possell frum?" asked
Hannah with irritation. "Whicherway is de sebben
starrs Joshua?" She asked as she changed the
subject.</p>

<p>"Day is skew-west over yander," said Joshua as
he went to the door to look out into the night;
"Und bress de Lord" he continued, "peers lak day
is a nussing de bero man und de munny er standin'
disserway purpundikkler, fo und aft?"</p>

<p>"Is yu ergwine to de town und hit pitch dark?"
enquired Hannah. "How in de name of Gord is
yu gwine to get to de tuther eend of de crick,
und yu bline ez a sand mole flung outer de ground?"</p>

<p>"Now yu's er flingin' a damper on my ambishun
ergin. How's I ergwine to fetch de munny back
epseps I gits to the tuther eend?" asked Joshua
crustily. "Duz yu speck me to slew frum wun
eend to the tuther lak a skeeter hork? Tell me
dat."</p>

<p>"Lors a massy" he cried out in pain, as he danced
around the room on one foot, "fur de hebbins sake
fling dat ole free-legged cheer outer dis house into
de mash. Grate Jarryko! de debble has sho got
hisself tangled up wid de harrydatterments of dis
house. Yu mouter knowed dat pizened cussed
impelment was ergwine to cum in contack wid sum
of my jints."</p>

<p>"Yu jess nuss dat ole hoof of yourn in boff hands
lak dat," said Hannah provokingly "twell I strikes
a lite und den I'm ergwine to clap fur yu to dance
er misshunery reel."</p>

<p>"Don't tanterlize me no mo Hanner wid dem reels
und me in all dis rack und missury! Grate Jarryko!
Dis heer ole happy sack haint ergwine to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
hole all dat munny," observed Joshua, after a moment
and still groaning with pain.</p>

<p>"Den you mout take de bofat, und de blu chiss,
und den dare's de wheel borrer und de steer kyart.
Fetch all yu kin Joshaway, fur me und yu is ergwine
to need hit every bit und grane. Dat ole
beaver of yourn wid de tip eend er flipperty-flopity
disserway und datterway, same ez a kyte in de gale
is jamby gin out, und den dares de lan, und de grate

forty, und de kalliker kote, und de snuff, und&mdash;und&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Don't fling no mo unds&mdash;unds&mdash;at me," interrupted
Joshua in disgust, "epsep yu aims fur me
to drap rite back into de bed, whay I wur wen de
proklermashun isshued."</p>

<p>Hannah made no answer to this effusion of temper,
but going slyly to an old chest in the corner,
she took from it a bottle containing a gill or more
of ardent spirits and giving it to the old negro,
said, "Anint dat ole jint wid dis good truck, Joshaway,
hit will swage de missury."</p>

<p>Joshua looked up with a countenance beaming like
the full moon coming out of a black cloud, and playfully
said to his old wife, "Honey I kin swage de
missury mo better disser way;" drank it down and
then exclaimed, "Bress God, dat sarchin pain is dun
und gon."</p>

<p>"Dont you forget honey," said Joshua again,
patronizingly as he was about stepping out of
the door with his stick and haversack, "dat nex
Saddy, arter dis Saddy cummin, dem dare high
steppers dats gwine to cum home wid me dis arternoon
is ergwine to raise a harry kane 'twixt dis
house und de federick sammyterry whay old Semo
und dat secesh gubberner is ergwine to preach de

when me und yu gits into de kerrige, great Jarryko!
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
I'm ergwine to hole dem rones disserway, und
whern day gits 'twixt de flatform und ole glory,
I'm ergwine to histe 'em up on dare hine legs, jess
so, see!"</p>

<p>Old Hannah clapped her hands with joy and
laughed again and again "Bress Gord" she exclaimed
with excitement; "yu is same ez a yurling
colt yoself Joshaway, I'm ergwine to give yu a
moufful of fodder and shet yu up wid de steer,
kase de way yu's a histing up yo rare legs und er
chompin' de bit, yu's ergwine to eat up de gyarden
sass same as de steer."</p>

<p>Joshua looked scornfully at his wife and observed
with a fierce scowl, "Day haint no passifyin' wun
of dese backslewed mefodiss epseps yu's er totin
every bit of de strane yoself, fo I gits back wid de
kerrige und de hosses," he continued quite earnestly
"Yu mout move all de harry detaments outen
de house, ready fur de grate house, und yu mont
rent dis house to ole Semo pervidin' he pays de
rent, und you mout turn de munny over to de darters
of de sammytary siety."</p>

<p>"Ugh! Ugh! I heers yu; fetch dem nales und de
snuff Joshaway!" Hannah halloed as Joshua now
in a good humor limped away in the darkness
singing merily;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When I was ergrwine down de field,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">De blacksnake bit me on de heel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Und ez I riz to fire my best<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I run ergin a yaller jacket's nest.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Yaller jackets indeed" echoed Hannah as she
proudly tossed her aged head, "when Joshua fetches
dem rones und kerrige, dare haint ergwine to
be no yaller jackets on me ur him udder."</p>

<p>The village was thronged with the black wards
of the government, when Joshua arrived wearied
and hungry. Allured by expectations that had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
been most wantonly excited, the negroes flocked
into the town with trunks, valises, travelling bags,
some of them of the most primitive description,
within which to put their pensions. Flattering expressions
came from truly loyal hearts, when the
agent of the freedman's bureau ascended the court
house steps to address the freedmen. His very
presence was like the sunlight over the darkened
land, but alas; he was the man who was to pass out
to each and all of the misguided negroes the cup
of disappointment and bitterness, and they in their
nakedness and stupidity would drink its lees with
the desperate resoluteness of fanatics.</p>

<p>Joshua stood with his old skinny hands clasped
upon his bosom, looking up in an attitude of reverence.</p>

<p>"Grate Jarryko!" he said to himself; "Ef dis
bellion hadn't upriz de ole isshu nigger mouter
been way back yander a totin' de grubbin hoe fur
Jeff Davis, de secesh, und de ole bull whup er natally
cryin fur de po niggers meat. Ef Hanner
seed dis site, she'd jine de mishunary's, kase she
mouter node dat providence had sont dat bero man
und hit is mo better dan grace."</p>

<p>The old negro saw the diamonds glittering upon
the enameled shirt bosom of the agent and he said
again in rapture.</p>

<p>"Day is same ez de starrs in de hellyments."</p>

<p>He saw a huge chain dangling from his neck, and
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Grate Jarryko! ef de ole ship of Zion wur to git
shipracked in Galilee, yu mout grapple her wid
dat dare chain und hit mout hole twell de harrykin
swaged."</p>

<p>The old negro was lost in wonder, and at last
overpowered by fatigue, and the press of the
throng, he dropped out of line and fell asleep upon
an empty crate. How long he slept does not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
enter into the chronicle. There were mischievous
boys then as there are now, and whilst he slept
they collected from old bureau drawers one hundred
dollars of brand new confederate treasury notes of
the issue of 1864, and placed them loosely in his beaver
and covered it over with his red pocket handkerchief.
Upon awaking, Joshua rubbed his eyes,
and then his knees and his elbows; looked around
dazedly, and exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Consound my buttons, ef de bero man haint
dun und penshuned off de niggers, und gon; und
dis heer nigger a drapped back to sleep, lak a idgeot,
wid nary cent of de penshun. Grate Jarryko!
I knows what Hanner is ergwine to say; she's
ergwine to ax me erbout de hosses, und den she's
ergwine to aggravate me wid providence dis, und
grace dat, und mishunary heer, und meferdis dare.
Ef yu'd pervided yoself wid sum of dat grace down
at Filadelfy meetin' house Joshaway, she's ergwine
to say, you mouter fotched de rones und de kerrige
too. Grate Jarryko! hit peers lak provedense hez
dun und flung de fat in de fire arter all."</p>

<p>Taking up his old hat, the confederate money
went scurrying here and there; the old negro
looked around him suspiciously, and exclaimed in
an excited way.</p>

<p>"Grate Jarryko! whicherway did all dis munny
cum from? hit wur provedense dat time und no
mistake; now yu sees Hanner which wun of dem
meeting houses is got de under holt; Yu's dun und
hilt to grace, und me runs wid fafe, und whicherwun
is got de munny? Tell me dat?"</p>

<p>Whilst Joshua was sleeping, Hannah was busy
hammering and packing the scant furniture for its
removal to the great house, and at high noon everything
was out of doors. The squealing pig was fettered
like a convict, and old Boatswain, the coon
dog, was tied and howling like a catamount. Joshua
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
placed the money into his haversack, with the
nails and snuff, looked up at the setting sun, and
said to himself.</p>

<p>"I mout let Hanner pick out dem hosses, und de
kerrige, kase she mout not like de rones."</p>

<p>The old negro struck a bee-line for home with the
further observation.</p>

<p>"Grate Jarryko! ef hit warnt fur Ganderbilt, I
specks dis ole nigger mout be de richest man on
de top side of de yurth."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment and said.</p>

<p>"I dun und forgit; I'm mo'est sho Hanner is ergwine
to ax fer sperrets fur her griping missury."</p>

<p>And he stepped into the nearest groggery and
purchased a pint or more with the money an old
friend had given him.</p>

<p>"Now den ole town, I bids yu farwell twell yu
sees me und Hanner in de kerrige."</p>

<p>As Joshua was going on toward home his mind
became speculative. Great schemes in a crude way
were thought of, and he said to himself.</p>

<p>"Now dat de munny is dun un riv, ef I ketches
Hanner wun mo time wid a hoe in her hands, I'm
ergwine to git a vorcement. She mout take lessons
on de peanny-forty from dat white gal in de grate
house und play de hopperatticks arternoons arter
me und her hez driv over de plantushun und seed
to de craps. When I gits home I'm ergwine to
berry dis munny under de tater hill und I haint
ergwine to let Hanner spishun whay I keeps hit,
kase she'll buy all de hosses in de Newnited States
und finely hit will all be gone. I'm ergwine to
fling de whup und pull de ribbuns myself, und ole
Semo de secesh jess got to git outen de grate
house. Lemme see how dese sperrets tastes," he
said. And he reached in his ole haversack, got the
flask and put it to his mouth. "Gurgle, gurgle,
gurgle; umph," he said, smacking his lips, "dat is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
sho good truck. Is yu got gumpshun nuff ter
count dis munny, specks it oversizes your judgment,
ole hoss," and he began to count upon his
fingers, "five hundred, hundred fousand, hundred
million. Great king! what am I gwine ter do wid
dis munny; ef ole Mars Linkun cud see Joshaway
now, wid his freedom und de grate house und de
plantashun und de hosses, he wud larf und larf
frum wun eend of his mouf to the tother. You
see's now Mr. Bellyun what yu is dun und dun fur
yosef crackin de whup ober de po nigger."</p>

<p>A distance of two miles had been placed between
the old negro and the village and he had two more
miles to go. One mile ahead ran with a swift current
the black waters of Chowattuck, but there
was a substantial foot log thrown across it, and it
was ordinarily safe. Joshua had gone but a little
farther when he wanted to sample "dem dar sperrets
agin," "Pen upon it, I nattally feels dat ar truck
er oozin outen my toe nails." The "tikler" was
turned up again, and gurgle, gurgle, gurgle sang
the fiery spirits. The money now had greatly multiplied;
the trees upon the roadside were somersaulting,
and the road itself, like a serpent, was
twisting in and out about his tangled legs. Joshua
stopped in sight of the water with the observation.</p>

<p>"Hole on dar ole hoss, what is yu ergwine ter do,
dis munny aint ergwine to tote yu ober dis crick;
ole glory back yander aint gwine ter heer yu hollow,
what is yer gwine to do?"</p>

<p>He put his hands upon his old knees, and rubbed
them down, brought his coat sleeves with a fierce
swing across his cavernous mouth, fetched a grunt
or two, then planted his feet upon the foot-log.</p>

<p>"Studdy yosef ole hoss, studdy yosef, ef yu draps
inter dis heer crick und gits drounded, it's ergwine
to bust up ebery scalyhorg in der souf."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Three times he tried to walk the log and as often
fell off before reaching the water.</p>

<p>"Konsoun de crick," he muttered, "hit hadn't
orter be heer no how, er pesterrin fokses er cummin
und er gwine; pears lak now de bellion is dun
und fell dere is a dratted crick at ebery crook in
de rode; blame my hide ef I aint gwine ercross ef
I has ter crawl lak a santypede; I kin straddle de
dratted fing un I kin git ercross arter a fashun,
but what is I gwine ter do wid de happy-sak und de
munny? I is bleeged ter use bof hands ter hold on
to de dratted log when I slips und slides, und I
kaint tote de happy-sak in my mouf, kase I haint
got but one ole snag in my hed, and hit is in de
furder eend; consound it, whay it hadn't orter be
no how. I kin tie de happy-sak to de kote keerts,
und den ole hoss, yu und me kin land on de tother
side of de crick lak a kildee. Ef I was ergwine
tother way dar wud be a passel ob kaarts cummin
dis way; dey is allus gwine de rong way at de rong
time." So argued Joshua as he fastened the haversack
to the only button on the back of his coat.</p>

<p>"Now den ole buttun, ef yu was ter brake loose,
un drap yu wud werk bigger strucshun dan a yeth-shake,
dat yu wud. Provedense is ergwine to do
hits part ef Hanner is dun und dun hern."</p>

<p>Slipping and sliding, the old negro was approaching
the other end of the foot log; his heavily
weighted coat skirts thumping against his shanks,
when he was sliding along under an overhanging
cypress bush about midway of the deep channel,
"kerchunk" some heavy object dropped into the
water.</p>

<p>"Grate Jarryko!" exclaimed the old negro alarmed,
"what a tremenjous mockisun snake dat was a
drapping off dat dar bush; I'm ergwine ter git erway
frum dis crick, sho yo born."</p>

<p>Slipping and sliding he finally got to the end,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and with the observation "Peers lak I feels mity
lightsum in de hine parts," he put his hand behind
him to feel for his haversack, and found it gone.</p>

<p>The loss of the treasure for the moment confused
the old negro, then he began to cry and swear, until
his grief at last found expression in the exclamation:</p>

<p>"Grate Jarryko! Dem passages o' scriptur erbout
fafe und erbout grace und erbout proverdense got
twisted und tangled togedder into a loblolly, und
bress de Lawd, dis heer happuning is de eend of
it all."</p>

<p>He then looked back upon the raging flood, utterly
forlorn, and plaintively addressed himself to
his situation:</p>

<p>"Now, whot's Hanner gwine ter do erbout dem
hosses und de kerrige und de grate house, und dey
kivered up in dat sloshy graveyard&mdash;drownded to

She mout say ergen dat ef dem sperrets hadn't got

<p>As Joshua approached his cabin he looked up
and saw his old wife sitting in a dilapidated rocking
chair, surrounded by the scant furniture, and

<p>He stopped abruptly and began to groan and
mutter.</p>

<p>"Grate Jarryko!" he exclaimed, as he vigorously
rubbed one foot against the other, "Ef yu's spectin'

<p>The old negro looked up again over the broken

<p>At this point Hannah observed Joshua zigzagging
across the field without horses or carriage, and
her wrath was exceeding fierce.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<h3>PATRIOTIC MEN DELIBERATING.</h3>


<p>At the hour of 3 p. m., in the early autumn of
186&mdash;, several representative gentlemen met by previous
agreement in the library of Colonel Seymour.
This congress of Southern leaders of the old school,
after the interchange of the usual courtesies, resolved
themselves into "A Committee of the Whole
upon the state of the Union," with Judge Bonham
in the chair, and was addressed at length by Governor
Ainsworth. This gentleman had honored his
state as one of its Senators in the Federal Congress;
again as Secretary of the Navy, and had
filled by successive elections the office of Governor
for three terms. He had reached that mellow age
when the intellect becomes largely retrospective.
The manner of this distinguished statesman was
singularly individual. In early life strongly inclined
to the contemplation of perplexing political
questions, he possessed a graphic, nervous force&mdash;a
kind of untamed vigor&mdash;a raciness of flavor in
speech that belonged only to the individual who
thought for himself. There were few men more
richly endowed; his intellect was of the highest
order&mdash;clear, rapid and comprehensive&mdash;combined
with an extraordinary facility of expressing and
illustrating his ideas, both in conversation and debate.
He possessed a rich imagination, a rare and
delicate taste, a gentle and sportive wit, and an
uninterrupted flow of humor, that made him the
delight of every circle. Nor were his moral qualities
less deserving of respect and admiration. He
was generous, brave, patriotic and independent.
He was the slave of no ambitious or selfish policy;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the hunter of no factitious or delusive popularity;
he spoke the language of truth, justice and wisdom.
A "throb of gratitude beat in the hearts of
the people," and the sentiment of an affectionate
respect glowed in their bosoms for the "old man
eloquent." His speeches, too, were essentially
characteristic, abounding in keen satire, humor,
and frequently in the most direct and idiomatic
language. Given to intense conviction rather than
to subtle discernment, and devoting his unusual
ability to studied effort, he could, whenever he
felt so inclined, "strip the mask from the hypocrite,
and the cowl from the bigot."</p>

<p>This was the man toward whom the patriotic
sentiment of the country was directed; the man
who might, by possibility, lash the raging Hellespont
into submission. "But what avail," said he
as he leaned heavily upon his staff, "are arguments
and protests? Can we charm the serpent into harmlessness
by the feeble chirping of the wren? Can
we tranquilize the country by indignant declamation?"
Then with an effort he assumed a poise
still more dignified and serious, as he continued:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, when the seas are lashed into a
rage, no matter who are the mad spirits of the
storm, they cannot say to their tumultuous waters,
'thus far shalt thou go, and no farther, and here
shalt thy proud waves be stayed.' There are other
powers in motion beneath its surface, which they
wist not of, and whose might they can neither direct
or control. I have stood upon the shores of
the mighty ocean, and observed the forerunners of
the coming storm. I have heard the moan of its
restless waters in the caverns of the great deep, and
have seen the upheaving of the billows, which rose,
and raged and tossed as foam from their bosoms,
the wild spirits that gendered the tempest. I envy
not the triumph of those who have troubled the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
waters; who have laid waste the South, who have
beggared her proud people. I had rather stand
with my countrymen powerless, but brave and unyielding,
than to wield the thunderbolts of Jove,
if I must employ their power and resource in wrong
and oppression. When the last spark of Roman
liberty was extinguished; when no voice but that
of Augustus was heard, and no power but that of
Augustus was felt, his venal flatterers vied with
each other in deifying their god, and degrading
those firm, defiant spirits who stood for their country
and its tranquility. Cæsar had subjugated the
world, all but the dark unbending soul of Cato. In
a catastrophe, such as this, let that band of patriots
to which it is my pride to belong, share in the
spirit of the last of the Romans; that spirit which
scorns to bow before any earthly power, save that
of their beleaguered country.</p>

<p>The reconstruction government has purposely
demoralized the economic conditions which contributed
to the prosperity of the South. Full well
it knew that the wealth of the people depended
upon their labor. There was a time when plunder
was the great resource of the nations of the
earth. The first kingdom was sustained by pillage
and conquest, and great Babylon, the glory of the
Chaldean empire, was adorned by the spoils of all
Asia; the Assyrian was plundered by the Persian,
the Persian by the Macedonian, and it at last devoured
by the Roman power. The wolf which
nursed its founder, gave a hunger for prey insatiable
to the whole world. There was not a temple
nor a shrine between the Euphrates and the salted
sea that was not pillaged by these marauders. The
tide of ages, century after century, had rolled over
the last fragment of Roman power; the light of science
had broken upon the world, before mankind
seemed to realize that our Creator, dead aeons ago
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
had said: 'By the sweat of his brow man should eat
his bread all the days of his life.'</p>

<p>Wealth is power, and the wealth of a nation is
its labor, its abundant control of all the great agencies
of nature employed in production. The products
of human labor, its food and clothing, like
the fruits of the earth are annual, and God in his
wisdom has adjusted human wants to their power
of production. Like the bread from heaven the
dews of every night produce the crops, and the labors
of every day gather the harvest. What, but
an almost boundless power of consumption and reproduction
has given to the South its athletic vigor,
and yet the enfranchisement of the negroes has
been a fatal blow to every industrial interest. It has
left our plows to rot in the furrow, and our plantations
to grow up in briers and brambles.</p>

<p>That liberty, which ranks in our organic law
next to life, is subjected to the caprice of those
who happen in the ever varying conditions of human
affairs to be placed over us as masters. The
South believed that the theory of the government
derived its chiefest captivation from its regard to
the equal rights of all its citizens and from its
pledge to maintain and preserve those rights. It
assumed to proclaim the happiness of the people
to have been the object of its institution, and to
guarantee to each and to all without limitation the
enjoyment of life, liberty, and property.</p>

<p>It has been reserved for the power of oppression,
in its active and diffused state, to give effect to the
unhallowed innovation upon the rights of the
South.</p>

<p>Reconstruction is the Gethsemane of southern
life. God's law is higher than man's law. Man's
feeble statutes cannot annul the immutable ordinances
of the Almighty. Those whom God has
put asunder, let no man join together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>Who could have foreseen that in the first century
of our existence African freedmen would rule
sovereign commonwealths, and become the judges
of the rights and property of a race who had ruled
the destinies of the world since governments&mdash;patriarchal,
monarchical or constitutional&mdash;was known
to man?</p>

<p>The true, sincere and rational humanitarian looks
with sorrow upon the future state of the misguided
negroes; for when this institutional age shall have
passed away, he sees the exodus or extirpation of
this disturbing element in the social and political
conditions of the more powerful sovereign race.
The authors of the infamous policy have written
their <i>hic jacet</i> against our civilization.</p>

<p>No where can there be found in the history of
any country where the civil and military policy
have been so basely prostituted, or where the safeguards
of liberty, life and property were ever entrusted
to freed slaves&mdash;human chattels; slaves who
never for a moment have been in a state of pupilage.
It is an epoch that marks the decadence of
the manhood and civilization of a great nation&mdash;homogeneous,
prosperous, enlightened and happy.
The nearest approximation to this era of ruin&mdash;of
social degradation&mdash;was when the slaves in Rome
were enfranchised by order of the emperor, and
conditions there were totally dissimilar. Whilst
they enjoyed certain rights and prerogatives of
manumission, they were still held to duties of obedience
and gratitude. Whatever were the fruits
of their toil and industry, their patrons shared or
inherited the third part, or even the whole of their
acquisitions. In the decline of this great empire,
the proud mistress of the world, we are told that
hereditary distinctions were gradually abolished,
and the reason or instinct of Justinian completed
the simple form of an absolute monarchy. In the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
eye of the law all Romans were equal and all subjects
were citizens. The inestimable character was
degraded to an obsolete and empty name. The
voice of a Roman could no longer enact laws or
create the annual ministers of his power.</p>

<p>"It may take many generations perhaps, for moral
changes are slow, to put out all our lights of
knowledge that are now beaming from every cottage
in the South; but one after another they will
be extinguished, and with them the beacon torch
of liberty. When the white men of the South
shall come to see how things are, and to realize the
downward tendency, physical, intellectual manhood
will make a throe to regain the height it has
lost, and if it fails, a storm will arise from the elements
they are compounding, that will break somewhere
and spend itself with desolating fury. They
cannot degrade a people who have been enlightened
and free, prosperous and happy, without igniting
a mass which they can no more control, than
they can the central fires of Vesuvius.</p>

<p>"Up to the commencement of hostilities between
the North and the South, there were in the South
millions of people employed directly or indirectly
in the honest and wholesome avocation of agriculture,
and by its great encouraging system, sustained
in a condition of existence, both moral and
physical, equally as prosperous and independent
as any other agricultural people in any other region
of the earth. They were white men who piece
by piece built up the whole superstructure, and
thereby reinforced the country with so much labor
and skill; furnished so much mutual employment
for that skill and labor, aided as they were by so
many instrumentalities of toil and agents of production.
What a country it was&mdash;supplied by this
system from the labor of our own hands and workshops,
with all the machinery, fruits of the earth,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and all the needful fabrics of human skill. This
great system comprehended every class and every
source of material wealth. Under this system our
people prospered. The white population of the
South came by descent from a parent stock, that
from the foundation of society had governed in
wisdom and moderation the most enlightened countries
of the world; who had written every constitution,
fought every battle, endowed every charity,
established every government, introduced every
reform that has given to the world its christian development
and progress.</p>

<p>"When these extra-hazardous reconstruction acts
were submitted to the Legislature of the South,
they refused to "chop logic" with the Reconstruction
party. It would have been contrary to
the experience of mankind, and an exception to all
the teachings of history, if in the high excitement
then prevailing&mdash;the exasperation of the people&mdash;the
outrages threatened and inflicted, the South
had yielded one jot or tittle or swerved from its
honest, patriotic convictions. The transition was
from a state in which the integrity and intelligence
of the white race, ennobled by centuries of meritorious
service, had ruled; to a government by a black
race that less than five generations before had
been hunted like wild beasts in the jungles of the
dark continent; who were handcuffed and decoyed
into slave ships, and who had been slaves until the
proclamation of President Lincoln emancipated
them in the territory protected by the U. S. Army.
The transition was to a condition of things in which
white men to the number of three hundred thousand
were disfranchised and deprived of the right
to vote and to hold office, and the enfranchisement
of more than a corresponding number of benighted
negroes with the right to vote and hold
office. The transition of the slave, was too sudden&mdash;too
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
alarming&mdash;too degrading. No people who were
proud of their traditions, their institutions, could
have looked upon such a change with complacency;
nor seen their local government pass into
the hands of their slaves&mdash;irresponsible, illiterate,
brutish, rapacious, without being goaded into violent
resistance.</p>

<p>"It has been remarked 'Oh Liberty, what crimes
are committed in thy name.' If the gift of the
elective franchise enabled the negro to protect himself
in his rights of person and property, the denial
of it to the white man took away from him
that protection and that right. They went even to
lower depths, and by the election and registration
laws basely surrendered into the hands of the carpet-baggers
all power. The judiciary, the last
refuge of the unfortunate and oppressed is stricken
down and stripped of both ermine and respectability.
The ballot box&mdash;the sanctuary of freedom&mdash;the
ballot box&mdash;the only secure refuge of liberty&mdash;the
ballot box, the armory where freedom's weapons
are wont to terrify tyrants, is made the charnel
house in which the assassinated liberties of a
defenceless, prostrated people are buried; is made
the dice box in which are staked and played for by
the freedmen of the South the revenues of plundered
commonwealths. What wonder in this lust
for power men should become strangers to the people
they govern, outlaws to honesty and patriotism.</p>

<p>"They know no law but that of force, and no God
but Mammon. They ply their theft upon every
citizen, enthrall him with taxation, deny him
the right to be seen or heard or felt at the ballot
box or before the court. In the train of these outrages
and indignities came a flood of unwholesome
oppressive laws, creating new offices, increasing the
salaries of incompetent and truculent officials, multiplying
the cost and expenditures of government,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and correspondingly increasing the burdens of taxation.
Then came martial law, militia campaigns,
loyal leagues, murders, arsons, burglaries,
rapes, and a reign of terror and intimidation to
make the way for the easy perpetration of the most
monstrous and unparallelled wrongs, frauds and outrages
that ever cursed the earth. The South, like
a beautiful captive, was turned over to be deflowered
and defiled. She could only cry in her desperation&mdash;"I
am within your brutal power, and
gagged and pinioned must submit."</p>

<p>"Our elective judiciary has contributed immeasurably
to the vicious, demoralizing spirit of the age."
The intelligent and upright judge is the representative
of the law in its simplicity, sufficiency and
learning. He is the living exponent of its justice.
Whatever the law is will appear in him, and whatever
it does will be done through him. The different
departments of industrial activity center in
him. The plowman in the field, the smith at his
anvil, the miner in the earth, the operative in the
factory, the banker at his desk, are all a vital part
of his being. He is the foremost agent of providence
in keeping up the natural distinction of race
and position. His creed is that men are not to be
antagonists, but friends. Differ they must in
usages and institutions, in habits and pursuits; but
in his opinion they differ, not that they may be
separated, but for a truer sympathy and a compacter
union. Mountains and seas insulate, language
and religion differentiate men, but the law
in its economical administration corrects these
things into the elements of a genuine brotherhood.
The fortunes of the world, so far as they are delegated
to human care, are in his hands. The peaceful
progress of society is blended with his personal
integrity. Commonwealths, corporations and individuals
vest their wealth, their reputation, their
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
security in him, and if any one man more than another
is under the most sacred of earthly obligations
to be an example of the highest integrity, the
most exact justice, the noblest virtue of thought,
word and action, it is the judge of our courts of
record. No feudal baron&mdash;no courtly knight&mdash;ever
had the power that may now be exercised by him.</p>

<p>"Our civilization pledges us to the sway of moral
principles; its rule is imperative, because we have
assumed the title of men, domesticated our hearts,
and accepted the religion of Jesus Christ. Judicial
life, by the earnestness with which it has acted
in the past crisis of our state and national history,
by the patriotic devotion and interpretation
of the constitution and the laws made in pursuance
thereof, by its conservative temper in resisting
fanaticism, vice, corruption and fraud has shown itself
a watchful guardian of the momentous trusts
confided to its keeping. The honest, learned judge
has pledged himself for the faith of contracts and
treaties; he has jealously guarded the institutions of
the country and bravely upheld them as the embodiment
of our doctrines and our hopes. The traditions,
laws and customs of the country have been
committed to him, and with the ever active jealousy
of encroachment, he has not disguised his fears of
centralization or oppression. Hitherto, irrespective
of all party relations, the judicial system was
slowly but surely working out the great problems
of domestic prosperity. Times have changed, however,
and we have changed with them. Our present
elective judiciary is indeed the black vomit of reconstruction.</p>

<p>"It may be seriously questioned whether under
any circumstances the elective system is adequate
for the purpose designed. All classes, high and
low, sooner or later come before the tribunal of
justice. Its judgments and decrees affect the humblest,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
as well as the most powerful individual and
control the strongest combinations of men. We
know that it is utterly impossible to keep the
nomination and election clear of mere political influences
and those of the worst kind. It is said
that revolutions never go backward; nevertheless
in the teeth of the adage I confess that I can see
no better way of selecting judges than the mode
pointed out by the unamended constitutions and
the laws and by the general good sense of mankind.
I believe that this method is wise and conservative,
in harmony with our institutions and sufficiently
democratic to satisfy the people. All the rest is
faction, demagogism and cabal. The judge should
represent no interest, no party, only the law; he is
an umpire between man and man, between the individual
and the body social.</p>

<p>"What is required in the judge is ability, learning,
integrity. In public station it is as necessary
to be thought honest as to be so, and the moment
the popular mind once takes in the true position of
the elective judge, the moment that it perceives
the magistrate to be possessed of neither true power
nor real dignity, and exposed perpetually to
temptation, that moment the influence and usefulness
of the judge will be destroyed. Their judgments
in such cases will be received without respect
and obeyed only so far as they can be enforced,
and if the people shall ever break down and trample
under foot the defences of unpopular power;
the Judiciary will be scouted from their seats, their
filthy and tattered ermine will be torn from their
backs, and they will be driven out into hopeless
ignominy as the meanest of sycophants, and the
most truculent of demagogues.... A hundred and
eighty years ago the English parliament, sick of
the miseries resulting from a corrupt judiciary,
changed the tenure of the office, abolished their
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
dependence on the sovereign and made the tenure
of their existence dependent on their good behavior
alone. From that time to this the English
judiciary has risen in character and influence.
With us the system is elective. The judicial candidate,
like a fish monger, goes with his wares into
a market overt. He advertises his opinions&mdash;his
promises, he makes his pledges, he puts a premium
upon the ballot, he weighs to a nicety the
purchasable value of negro electors. The rival
candidate does the same, and hence the office is
purchasable at the price of manhood, integrity,
learning and capacity. Thus the whole machinery
of the courts is run with an eye single to making
political capital for the radical party and intensifying
their hatred toward the South.</p>

<p>"And now gentlemen," the governor said in conclusion,
"our meeting here to-day will be without
its influence upon a power that can 'kill and make
alive.'"</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the speech of the governor,
it was resolved that messengers should be sent to
the president with full power to enter into any
treaty or compact for the maintenance of peace
and order, and that Governor Ainsworth and Colonel
Seymour shall be charged with the execution
of the mission.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<h3>THE MILLS ARE GRINDING.</h3>


<p>It was the hour of high noon that a gentleman
and lady alighted from a carriage at the foot of the
mansion of Colonel Seymour without previous announcement.
The gentleman was a person of attractive
presence and perhaps forty-five years of
age. The lady was not attractive, a little patronizing
in her manners, and perhaps thirty-five years
of age. Their <i>patois</i> was that of English people;
to an artistic ear, however, this may have appeared
feigned. Their manner in the presence of the host
was unconstrained; indeed they expressed themselves
with unusual freedom. The gentleman gave
his name as Mr. Jamieson, and the lady as his
niece, Miss Harcourt, both of them lately arrived
from London. He had interested himself, he said,
in scientific researches for the past few years, and
was now pursuing an inquiry that he hoped would
be of practical use to the South. The "London
Society," whose agent he was, was seeking from
all available sources the most exhaustive information
about the negro in his gradations from the
savage to the citizen; and he took occasion to say
that his principals had been greatly astonished because
of the alarming strides the negro had made
in a country that, less than a century ago, made
the British power tremble in its very strong-holds.
He would be pleased to ask if this sudden transition
from slavery to freedom had not reversed the
orderly procedure of the government in respect to
its administration in the South. To this inquiry
Colonel Seymour replied, quite epigrammatically,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
"that the world had no precedent for the revolutionary
measures which were being enforced in the
South."</p>

<p>The stranger continuing, observed that he had
desired this interview before exploiting a field untried
and perhaps dangerous; and he would be
greatly obliged if his host would be as frank and
communicative as possible.</p>

<p>In the course of this interview, the arguments
employed by the stranger disarmed the old man's
suspicions, and in a confidential way the Colonel
told Mr. Jamieson that he would communicate his
knowledge of the matters as far as he could, but
feared it would not be of much value, as he was
under suspicion by the Federal authorities; having
fought under Lee in the many battles of the South,
he was still vehemently protesting against the invasion
of his own country by the carpet bag government.</p>

<p>"You were, then, a Confederate soldier?" inquired
the stranger.</p>

<p>"Yes, and was paroled at Appomattox," sententiously
rejoined the veteran.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear sir, you greatly interest me; may
I inquire your rank in the Confederate army?"</p>

<p>"I was a Colonel of cavalry, sir."</p>

<p>"Were you at Gettysburg, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and was wounded as we were falling back
to the Potomac."</p>

<p>"Gettysburg! Ah, yes!" the stranger observed reflectively;
"this battle was quite disastrous to the
South, I believe, and was claimed by the North as
a great victory."</p>

<p>"And what upon the face of the earth have they
not claimed?" excitedly replied the veteran.</p>

<p>"Ah yes, they are a boastful people," said Mr.
Jamieson. "I doubt not they claimed victories
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
they never won. You of course are still of the
opinion that the South was right?"</p>

<p>"No opinion about it. I know she was right. We
never resorted to hostilities until our institutions
were assailed."</p>

<p>"I am sure your statement is correct, sir," said
the Englishman. "While our government, then in
the control of a radical ministry, was officiously
unfriendly to the South, your government had a
great army of sympathizers in England who deplored
its downfall; indeed, the president of our
society was an active sympathizer with your country,
and the bank in which he was a director, upon
his private account emitted bills of credit that
were used by the agents of the Confederate government
in the purchase of materials of war. I
presume, sir," continued the Englishman, "you
would have no hesitation in going to war again if
the same casus-belli existed?"</p>

<p>"No indeed, sir."</p>

<p>"And you are of opinion that it would not be
treasonable to oppose the policy of the government
in respect to its acts of reconstruction?"</p>

<p>"If armed with adequate power, I should not hesitate
in respect to my duty in the premises," replied
the veteran with a show of temper.</p>

<p>"I am very glad, sir, that you have been entirely
frank with me," said the stranger, "and I fully
appreciate your feelings. I suspect that you do
not think that a strongly centralized government
in any contingency is the least oppressive form of
government?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly not, sir. Nature has established a
diversity of climates, interests and habits in the
extensive territories embraced by the Federal government.
We cannot assimilate these differences
by legislation. We cannot conquer nature. Other
differences have been introduced by human laws
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
and adventitious circumstances, very difficult, if
not impossible to be adjusted by Federal legislation,
hence the necessity of local legislatures with
adequate powers, and a general government with
its appropriate powers."</p>

<p>"I presume, sir," said the stranger, "that you
cannot conscientiously support the reconstruction
measures of Congress and the president?"</p>

<p>"I cannot and will not, sir," responded Colonel
Seymour with emphasis; "and if you were advertant
to that point of time in the history of our late
war when, from sheer exhaustion, the South laid
down its arms, you would not ask the question.
There were hundreds of thousands of patriotic
men in the North, who, upon the question of the
emancipation of the negro, concurred in its propriety,
yea, its necessity, but who denounced those
reactionary measures that were crystalized and enforced
with cruelty against the South. In our judgment
these measures were not only extra-hazardous,
but inherently oppressive. It would have
been a pernicious power in the hands of an intelligent,
conservative, law-abiding people, but most
deadly in the hands of ignorant, unscrupulous and
truculent officials. You must remember that the
South, in a metaphorical sense, was an immense
area sown in grain ready to be harvested, with its
hedges trampled under foot and destroyed, and inviting
cattle and swine to enter and devour. The
herds came greedily through every gap, and like
the wild beasts upon our western prairies, depastured
and consumed almost the whole."</p>

<p>"How wonderfully recuperative have been the
energies of your people sir," interrupted the stranger.</p>

<p>"Yes, but will you allow me to proceed?" replied
the Colonel; "We believed that when the war ended,
the people of the South relying upon the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
pledges made by the union generals in the field
before the armies were disbanded; on the negotiations
preceding the surrender; on the proclamation
of President Lincoln; and the publications of the
press; as well as upon the terms actually agreed on
between Grant and Lee, and Johnson and Sherman,
at the time of the capitulation of the Confederate
armies; that when resistence to federal authority
ceased, and the supremacy of the constitution of
the United States was acknowledged; and especially
after the ordinances of secession were repealed,
and an amendment to the constitution, abolishing
slavery wherever it existed, was ratified by the
legislatures of the insurrectionary states; that a
full and complete restoration of the southern states
to their former position of equal states would at
once take place; and after the exhaustion of such
a war they hailed the return of peace with satisfaction;
they acknowledged defeat; accepted the situation,
and went to work to rebuild their waste
places and to cultivate their crops. The men who
composed the union armies, found on their return
home, a healthy, prosperous, peaceable and well
organized society; while the government with a
prodigal hand freely distributed pay, pensions,
and bounties. It was not so in the south; society
here was disorganized; the strain upon the people
to supply the armies in the fields had exhausted
their resources; labor was absolutely demoralized;
the negroes being freed, in their ignorance and delusion
were not slow to understand their changed
condition, and became aggressive, riotous and lawless.
Under such circumstances it was impossible
to restore harmony in the civil government without
the utmost confusion; yet so earnestly did our
people struggle to return to their allegiance and
thus entitle them to the protection which had been
promised, that from the day of the surrender of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
the Confederate army, not a gun has been fired; no
hostile hand has been uplifted against the authority
of the United States, but before breathing time
even was allowed, a set of harpies, many of whom
had shirked the dangers of the battle field, pounced
down upon our people to ravage, plunder, and
destroy. All remonstrances, entreaties, resistances
were stifled by the cry of treason and disloyalty
and by the hollow pretence that the plunderers
were persecuted because of their loyalty to the
Union. A system has grown up in the South with
obstinacy, whereby great protected monopolies
are fostered at the expense of its agricultural labor;
then follow the series of offensive measures
known as the reconstruction acts; but one further
observation sir, and I have done. The English people
had no just conception of the oppressions want
only inflicted upon the South; of the insolence and
rapacity of the carpet-baggers and freedmen who
were made our masters."</p>

<p>There was quite an interval before the stranger
replied.</p>

<p>"Your address sir has been a revelation indeed;
it is a lesson of great educational value and I sincerely
hope I may hear you again. Would you
care to present your views in writing?"</p>

<p>The Colonel without any suggestion of evil said
to the stranger. That possibly at some future day
he might find the leisure to do so.</p>

<p>"And now you must allow me to thank you, before
leaving, for the courtesy you have shown. I shall
take pleasure in reporting this interview."</p>

<p>Colonel Seymour upon entering his wife's chamber
remarked to her "I have found a friend in
need; an Englishman who was delightfully entertaining
and who represents certain humanitarian
interests. I expect to hear something very flattering
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
to the South when he submits a report to his
principal."</p>

<p>Mrs. Seymour who had passed that period in
life, when she could look hopefully upon anything,
observed quite sadly. "I hope it is so, my dear husband;
I hope the future has very much happiness
in store for you; but I am suspicious of strangers
who seem to have no other business with you, than
to obtain your views upon the unhappy events that
are girdling our home as it were with a zone of
fire." "Ah," exclaimed the husband, "you do not
understand, perhaps your opinion will change in a
few days."</p>

<p>"I hope so" the sick lady replied feebly.</p>

<p>We pretermit events more or less irritating to
follow the urbane Englishman. The reader has
perhaps surmised that he was an agent of the secret
service bureau. This was true, as Colonel Seymour
learned to his sorrow, within forty eight
hours after the man and the lady dropped out of
the wide open arms of the old mansion. But how
could a southern gentleman withhold knowledge
when sought under such a disguise. He spoke as
he felt; and if the weapons that he used to punctuate
his expressions were boomerangs that impaled
him on its points, he could not help it. Anywhere,
everywhere, he would have spoken his convictions
without concealment, without equivocation.
Laflin came to Ingleside; came to foreclose
a poor man's liberty, without a day of redemption.
The old man saw the offensive carpet-bagger
approaching the mansion and met him sternly
with the interrogatory. "What is your business?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" sneeringly answered the carpet-bagger,
"that is a fine question to ask a gentleman. Do you
recognize that seal sir" he continued, handing the
old man an official requisition bearing the broad
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
seal of the department of justice upon it "you will
perhaps conclude, sir, that it will be compatible
with your safety to return with me; I promise you a
safe conduct to Washington."</p>

<p>"I will go with you" replied the old man with all
the suavity possible, "but you will allow me to prepare
for the journey."</p>

<p>"Certainly sir," said Laflin, "but I must see that
you do not provide yourself with arms."</p>

<p>"I do not want my house polluted by your presence,"
cried the old man in the vehemence of his
feelings.</p>

<p>"Then you shall go as you are," gruffly replied
the carpet-bagger.</p>

<p>Alice had but little to say to the man, knowing
that entreaty or expostulation would be unavailing,
and Clarissa slunk away from him as if he were
the forerunner of the plague. When the Colonel
arrived in the village he saw the white-haired
governor with his overcoat upon his arms, and his
valise and umbrella upon a chair beside him. He
knew intuitively that their missions were the same,
that their destination was Washington.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here governor?" asked
Colonel Seymour.</p>

<p>The dejected man replied deliberately, "I am going
to Washington sir. May I ask your destination
as I observe you are traveling too?"</p>

<p>"You see my guide, do you not," answered the
Colonel with a frigid smile.</p>

<p>"Yes and I am informed he is mine also; so we
shall not get lost on the route shall we?" answered
the governor lugubriously. "I presume we shall
have a suite of rooms at the old capital," asked
the Colonel provokingly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, if the President doesn't invite us
to the executive mansion. I hope he will do this
as I have no bank account North, and but little
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
currency in my pocket," replied the Governor in
irony. "By the way Colonel," continued the Governor,
"did you have an elegant gentleman and his
niece to call upon you a few days ago? Quite an
interesting man was he not? I hope we shall have
a good report from him when he returns home."</p>

<p>"And were you confidential toward this man?"
asked Colonel Seymour.</p>

<p>"Why yes, quite so," replied the Governor innocently.
"I found him so agreeable and so intelligent
withal, that I told him all that I knew and
I am expecting great things when I hear from
him."</p>

<p>"Do you think, Governor," asked the Colonel
quizzically, "that the Englishman has given us free
transportation to Washington to be examined and
punished as suspects?"</p>

<p>"Why my dear sir" replied the old Governor,
"you alarm me. Is it possible we are the dupes of
a government spy so clever and intelligent?"</p>

<p>"That is my opinion, sir," replied the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Is it possible? My, my, my!" he ejaculated, and
sank back in the upholstered seat, and after awhile
fell asleep.</p>

<p>These were men who had made the wager of battle
for eleven proud commonwealths and lost; men
coming now with their patriotism repudiated, to be
told that their traditions were treasonable, their
principles insurrectionary; to be badgered into
compliance; to be scourged into submission; men
who believed with a living faith that they had
given American reasons for convictions that ought
not to be challenged, coming now heroically to receive
their doom.</p>

<p>The Governor, on entering the great judgment
hall with Colonel Seymour, was surprised to see in
the person of the chairman a highly honored colleague
upon the committee of ways and means in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
the congress of 1858. The recognition was mutual,
and the distinguished chairman descending from
the dais, demonstratively grasped the old Governor's
hand, exclaiming, "My dear sir, what has
brought you here?" The excess of joy experienced
by the Governor quite overcame him, and for a moment
he did not answer, but he replied after awhile
as coherently as he could, that he had never been
informed of the charge against him.</p>

<p>"Ah!" replied the chairman sympathetically,
"That is indeed regretable, but the discipline of
this court does not contain within itself the germ
of an arbitrary prerogative. No man, however
bitter may be his opinions shall be condemned unheard."
The Englishman, under the alias of Mr.
Jamieson appeared as a witness in the person of
Jonathan Hawkins.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to go through the trial that followed.
"You are at liberty," said the chairman,
at its conclusion, "to go wheresoever you will. You
shall be safeguarded while you remain in the city,
and we shall exert our utmost to protect you and
your interests at home. Mr. Laflin," he continued,
"you will procure passports for these gentlemen
whom you have brought here without a pretext
of reason."</p>

<p>Our old friends, taking up their hats and canes,
returned their grateful thanks to the honorable
commission, whose judicial fairness was so praise-worthy;
and turned their faces homeward; the
Governor exclaiming through his clenched teeth,
"The infamous, villainous Englishman!"</p>

<p>"Why, bless my soul, Governor," exclaimed
the Colonel in a startled tone, "What an opportune
moment to have carried out the wishes of our
meeting!"</p>

<p>"What meeting do you refer to sir?" asked the
Governor in surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, my dear sir, had you forgotten that we
were deputized to visit the authorities in Washington
at the meeting presided over by Judge Bonham?"</p>

<p>"Well, well, well!" ejaculated the Governor,
"I verily believe, sir, if peace is not speedily restored
to the country that I will become a driveling
idiot."</p>

<p>The Colonel adroitly changed the subject by observing,
"It has occurred to me that if the practical
operation of the reconstruction acts was directly
in the control of the authorities in Washington, we
should see that they are our friends; I am sure
that the sentiment of the Northern people is in
favor of the restoration of the South, and would
counteract the vicious primary mischief resulting
from a criminal abuse of power&mdash;I mean that
power that is centralized in the Southern States."</p>

<p>"I am looking for conservative measures myself
from the wise men who are in charge of the government,"
replied the Governor. "The infernal
spoils system in the South, if not checkmated,
will destroy the country. This same spoils principle
has been the cause of more wretchedness and
guilt, individual and national, than any other in
the history of human suffering. It is the incentive
alike to the burglar who breaks and enters
your house at night and the highwayman who waylays
your path and takes your life; that, rising
from individuals to multitudes, it is the impelling
motive to all the plunderings and desolations of
military conquests; it forces the gates of cities;
plunders temples of religion; the great despoiler
of private rights and national independence. It
was the spoils system that united the barbarians
of the North and finally overthrew the vast fabric
of Roman policy law and civilization; and it is
this principle, worse than war, that has shaken
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
to their foundation our free and happy institutions.</p>

<p>Perhaps we shall meet at the cemetery to-morrow,
if there are no English spies around," suggested
the Governor.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; and adieu until then," replied the
Colonel, as they alighted from the cars.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<h3>A POLITICIAN OF THE NEW SCHOOL.</h3>


<p>Uncle Joshua was the color guard in a volunteer
company of negroes, whose muster roll, like a
thermometer, ran up into the nineties. As he shook
out the folds of the scarlet-veined banner of the
free one morning in his cabin, he observed to his
old wife, "Hit peers lak dat dare wus ernudder
wun o' dem possels, ef my membrunce sarves me
rite, dat toted de flag fur Ginrul Farryo when he
wus er heppin disserway und datterway froo de
dessart; but I moest furgit dat gemman's name.
Twant Absurdam, I'm moest sho, und hit twant
Jack-in-de-bed, nudder. Duz yu reckermember
dat possel, Hanner? Yu und de locus preacher is
erquainted wid all dem aintshunts."</p>

<p>"Umph!" grunted Hanna, "yu's gwine fur back
fur sumbody to tote de flag. Ef yu hez gin out why
don't you fling hit over to Efrum? Ur is yu aiming
ter immertate dat aintshunt?"</p>

<p>"Grate Jarryko!" exclaimed Joshua, irritated by
such a question. "Duz yu see dat fodder foot, und
duz yu see dat shuck foot? Well, den, when de
leftenant sez 'hep, hep, hep, hep, hep&mdash;fodder foot,
shuck foot!' I'm ergwine ter fling dem footsies out
disserway&mdash;see? Und I'm ergwine ter tote ole glory
fo und aft, jess so, twell I gits ter be de ginrul,
und den I'm ergwine ter fling dem identikle footses
in de saddle, disserway, und uprare de rone on
his hine shanks, jess lak dat."</p>

<p>"Umph!" grunted ole Hannah, "To be sho yu's
jess rivved out o' de babboon show! Yu's er sho
nuff limber Jack&mdash;jest ez suple ez a yurling gote,
ebery bit und grane!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, den," continued Joshua, without heeding
the ridiculous interruption, "I wuz studdin up dat
possel, when you flung yo mouf inter de argyment."</p>

<p>"Wuz dat gemman a Mefodis ur Mishunary?" inquired
Hannah, provokingly.</p>

<p>"Grate Jarryko! How's I ergwine to know dis
fur back? Kin I skiver er humans clean clar ercross
de dissart, und retch back ter de eend o' de yeth,
wid dese wun-eyed specks? Ef he hilt on to grace,
he wur a shoutin Mefodis; und ef he run wid Proverdense,
he wur a Mishunary; und ef he hilt on ter
sumfin wusser, he wur a harrytick. Dat's ez fur ez
I'm gwine, doubt I node fur sartin. I'm moest sho,
do, he wur a Mishunary, kase he didn't drap back
when he cum in contack wid de water."</p>

<p>"Grate king!" snapped Hannah, as she kindled
into a passion. "Wuz yu dare? Yu talks lak dare
warnt no Mefodis mixed up wid dem harryticks;
gwine on wid yer warter in de bilin dissart! Better
git de Zion bushup to larn yu de scriptur."</p>

<p>"Oh, my sole!" groaned Joshua. "Ef hit warnt
fer de Mishunarys in dis Soufland, dare mout be
a wusser war dan ole Jeff Davis de secesh's. I'm ergwine
ter ax yer wun pint mo, und den me und Ole
Glory is ergwine ter hit de grit fur de conwenshun.
Which wun o' dem slidin elders o' yourn hilt a
confurence in dat dissart whey dare warnt no warter,
und no chickens nudder, und whay de po parished
up Mishunary hed to furrige er roun fer dare
dinner? Now den!"</p>

<p>There were shops and bazaars scattered here and
there about the public streets of the shire town
within the recesses of which sat colored women
selling their merchandise; now and then accentuating
some passing pageant by the clapping of hands
and other noisy demonstrations. There were disorderly,
ruffianly negroes, in greasy uniforms,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
neither brigaded or disciplined, patrolling the
country, discharging their muskets at random; and
about the premises of Colonel Seymour there
was a squad, more or less menacing, marching and
counter-marching in the carriage way near the mansion,
and the old man in his desperation cried out
"Oh that I could gird the sword upon my thigh,
like the man Barak, and could smite these devils
to the earth."</p>

<p>"Mars Jon," interrupted Clarissa, "yer mout as
well let dese devilis niggers lone; de Lord is agwine
to slam dem to de yearth fore dey knows it; he is
agwine to vour dem up lak hoppergrasses; day a
ransakin all ober creashun fur franksized niggers
to wote de yaller ticket in de convenshun; mout as
well hab so many billy goats a wotin fur ole Abrum
Laffin, de meanest, low downest scalyhorg in de
wurrel. Yander goes ole Joshaway now, wid ole
glory strode er roun him, steppin lak a rare-hoss
ober de tater ridges agwine to de town." And she
pointed to a group of four crossing the field from
Joshua's cabin, marching under the stars and
stripes, that swung lifelessly over old Joshua's
right shoulder. We had just as well go with Joshua
and witness the proceedings. The first observation
the old negro made as he came up was this,
"How much is de boss agwine to gib fur wotin fur
him to go to de legislatur?"</p>

<p>"Agwine to giv yer, yer axes," replied a partisan
of Laflin. "Yer dun und got freedom, haint
yer? yer dun und jined de milintary cumpny, haint
yer? Yer is de most selfishes nigger dat I ebber
seed. Is yer aimin to git de whole kommisary
flung in? What mo dos yer speck?" continued the
black partisan. Freedom haint nebber made de
pot bile at my house nary time, und it haint
nebber fotched no sweetenin dar, und it haint
put no sperrets in de jimmyjon, und it haint nebber
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
sot out no taters nudder, und wid all dis
lustration in de land, it haint agwine too, nudder.
Jess as well be a naked snow-bird wid nary whing
as wun ob dese franksized niggers. Too much freedom
in de lan now, und not nuff horgs and catfishes.
I'se been a wotin und a wotin eber since de
belyun fell&mdash;a trapsing to de town bakkards und
furruds, und I haint nebber got nuffin but freedom
yit&mdash;not eben de rappins ob my little finger; und
I has been hep, hep, hep, hep, heppin in de miluntary
cumpny ober tater ridges und fru de brier
patches und de skeeters, und de cap'in haint nebber
said nary time, Joshaway, I'm agwine to put
yaller upperlips on yer jacket, und I'm agwine ter
gib yer a sord wid a wheel. Nary time hab de boss
axed me how much meal I had in de gum, ur how
much taters I hab in de hill; und I haint nebber
had but wun little speck ob munny sense freedom
cum in de lan, und den it wus Federick munny. Ef
I dont git nuffin bettern dat I has got, und dat mity
quick, dis po nigger is agwine to drap outer de ranks
into de sametary. Dis here war has turned loose
a passel ob niggers all ober de kentry wid dere
freedum und muskets, und bress Gord dere aint
nary turkle in de swamp, nur catfish nudder, yu
mout say; und eben de sparrers when dey sees a
nigger a cummin shakes his tail, und sais 'ugh,
ugh; I'm agwine erway frum here.' Ole mars Jon
had rudder de hoppergrasses wud kivver de hole
lan, und de tarypin bugs too. Eber time de boss
gits lected he ups and sezs, sez he, 'Josh, de nex
time I runs I'm agwine to make yer er magistreet,
so yer kin sot on white fokses, und bress de Lord,
dat time haint nebber cum yit.'"</p>

<p>"Shut dat big mouf ob yourn," sharply commanded
Laflin's constituent.</p>

<p>"I haint agwine to do dat, nudder," saucily replied
the old negro. "Ef de boss don't gib me er
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
dram, ur sumfing when I gits to town, I'm agwine
to wote fur tuther man. De ole ooman tole me to
ax de boss fur a kaliker kote; sed how dat she wus
jam nigh as ragged as a skeer-crow. Hanner is a
gitten monstrus tired ob freedom, und dese franksized
niggers&mdash;yer heers my racket. Aye! aye,"
he exclaimed patriotically, "dars ole glory now
a shinin froo de trees," and with that the bandy
shanked negro cut a pigeon wing in the middle of
the road; and sure enough, the banner of the free,
displaying its broad stripes and bright stars was
nodding its welcome to its African heroes, who
had worked out their emancipation with ploughshares
and scythe blades.</p>

<p>"I knows," the negro continued in rapture,
"when I sees dat butifullest flag er wavin und see-sawin
dat dere is bound to be a stummic full ob
good whittles sumwheres, but I's monstrous skeert
hits agwine to gib out fore hit gits to me." And
just now the faintest tintinnabulation of an asthmatic
brass band broke upon old Joshua's ear like
the sound of a dinner horn, on a long, dry summer
day. Joshua braced up for the home stretch
and began to take long slouchy strides, as if he
were on the old parade ground again. Calling out
to his comrades "Forrud, march to de town; hep,
hep, hep, hep, hep, eyes to de front, charge, bagonets!"
As he approached the rallying ground of
the Laflin hosts, a recruiting agent from Laflin's
opponent, took him by the arm and said patronizingly,
"Let me put a bug in your ear, ole man."</p>

<p>Joshua jerked away with the startled cry "No
sar, no sar, don't do dat white man, kase I kaint
heer good no how, und ef yer puts dat ar bug in my
yeer, how in de name ob Gord is I ebber agwine to
git him outen dere eny more, and hit mout be a
horned bug ur a stingin bug. I'll fite eny man
dat puts a bug in my yeer, dat I will; stan back,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
white man; dont cum nigh me wid nun ob dem
creeturs."</p>

<p>"You don't understand me, my friend" replied
the scalawag, "our side are home folks, bred and
born right here, and we know what we can do for
our colored friends when we get to the legislature,
and we are going to buy plantations for our men,
and we are going to make our old friends like you
sheriffs."</p>

<p>"Dats a mity heep ob promisin, white man," replied
the negro suspiciously, "How menny shurrufs
is yer agwine to hab in dis county?"</p>

<p>"Forty seven," replied the Scalawag.</p>

<p>"How menny jail houses is yer agwine to hab,"
asked the negro.</p>

<p>"We are going to do away with the jails," said
he.</p>

<p>"Is?" exclaimed Joshua in surprise. "Ugh, Ugh!
forty-leven shurrufs in dis county und all clecting
taxes at wun time, Grate Jarryko, dar wont be
nary tater, nur nary horg, nur nary ole settin hin&mdash;nur
nary nigger in sebenteen fousan miles ob dis
place. Saks a live, white man, dos yer aim to
massercree fokes fo und aft? Whar wus yer when
dey fit de war enny how?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I was at home raising breadstuffs for the
poor," he answered.</p>

<p>"Raisin which fur de po, boss?" enquired Joshua.</p>

<p>"Breadstuffs," he replied.</p>

<p>"Und did de po git dey share?" asked Joshua.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," the scalawag answered.</p>

<p>"Und wus yer in de pennytenshun when yer
raised dat truck?" further enquired Joshua.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," he said.</p>

<p>Joshua gazed comically into the face of the politician
as he said; "Lemme look at yu rite good wid
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
boff eyes, wid dese ole specks on, disserway; dare.
Haint I seed yu afore?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so; I cant say" replied the scalawag
furtively.</p>

<p>"Ugh! Ugh!" exclaimed Joshua.</p>

<p>"Haint I seed yu at Zion's meeting house wun
time, at de stracted meetin? Dat time sister Cloe
drapped back into er concushun und yu wuz de
yarb doctor dat fotched her too, und yu tuck yo
pay outen de munny dat wuz gwine to de orfins?"</p>

<p>"No, no, you are thinking of some one else I am
sure."</p>

<p>"Und hit warnt yu nudder dat drunk up de
sakryment de dekons stode away under de mussy
seat?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed! why do you ask such a question?"</p>

<p>"Kase," replied Joshua quite saucily, "dem dare
too eyes of yourn puts me in membrance of dat
scalyhorg in de scriptur whay wuz drug outer de
kote house ded, him und Sofy Mariah, too, kase
day made er mis hit erbout dat lan."</p>

<p>"Oh Jerusalem!" retorted the scalawag "Lets
get back to the subject."</p>

<p>"Jess so! Jess so!" exclaimed Joshua, laughing,
"yu sees yu's dun und kotched, und yu aims to
drap back in de convenshun agen."</p>

<p>"We pay one dollar in gold and a jug of whisky
to every Laflin man that votes with us. Do you
hear?" observed the scalawag.</p>

<p>"Now yer is er a gettin down to de pint," exclaimed
the negro smiling. "Is yer man agwine
to git lected?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly, sir."</p>

<p>"Dats all right, den, when dos I git de munny
und de sperrits, fore I wotes ur arterwurds?" asked
Joshua dubiously.</p>

<p>"We don't pay in advance," replied the scalawag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't, hey?" exclaimed Joshua.</p>

<p>"Well Laflin], he do, und I mout wote fore I git
de pay, und yer man mout not git lected, den my
wote wud be flung away, und de munny und de
sperrits too, dats de pint. Yer see, boss," Joshua
continued argumentatively, "us franksized woters
is bleeged to make er leetle kalkerlashun und den
ef we gits disappinted its kase de white fokses
obersizes de niggers. Don't yer see how de cat is
agwine to jump, boss?" he whispered confidentially,
"yer mout put de spirits in de jimmyjon now,
und I mout take a drap ur too fore I wotes und yer
mout hold back de munny twelt yer man is lected;
how dos dat do?"</p>

<p>"All right," announced the scalawag. "You come
with me." And old Joshua in his "hop, step and
go fetchit" way followed the politician until he
brought up squarely against one of Laflin's lieutenants,
who took him savagely by the limp paper
collar.</p>

<p>"Wher's yer agwine lak a struttin turkey gobbler,
wid dat white man, yer fool nigger? Don't
yer know dat ar white trash will put yer back in
slabery?"</p>

<p>The rival candidates were running for the legislature.
On one side of the court house square
were aligned the adherents of Laflin, the carpet-bagger;
on the other side the adherents of Hale the
scalawag. Each was haranguing the black sovereigns
of the South&mdash;men who in other fields had toiled
ever so hard for their country, but whose hands
were unskilled, and whose minds were untutored
in this the grandest of human endeavors&mdash;the
building up of an immense superstructure that
shall stand "four square to all the winds that
blow."</p>

<p>Each candidate had his claquers, slipping into
rough, horny hands the paper representative of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
manhood, intellectual, patriotic manhood&mdash;manhood
compromised by no overt act of treason.</p>

<p>Every star and every stripe upon that magnificent
banner just overhead accentuated the fact
that in devious wanderings over blood stained battle
fields, fire scathed villages, homes and plantations
it had followed manhood suffrage as faithfully
as it did the tithing agent throughout the
South. Suspended above the heads of the free
men, across the street, was this blood-red warning
"No man shall vote here who followed Lee and
Jackson." Vain delusion; as if there could be
treason under that flag; or traitors lurking in its
shadows like mad Malays! Stranger still, that
the dust of Jackson should re-animate hearts that
had been broken in a catastrophe, too terrible to
be uttered by patriots. Strangest of all, that living
heroes should gather at a banquet where toasts
were spoken in frantic curses of the brave by fanatics!
To the right were barrels of whiskey on
tap; to the left were huge piles of yellow tickets
with appropriate devices upon them; and to the
front waved over a bloodless conquest the "Star
Spangled banner," just as triumphantly as it did
at the head of the charging battalions of Lee and
Jackson in Mexico, just as proudly as when the
Southern cross yielded its sovereignty upon the
ill-starred field of Appomattox. Crimsoned to a
deeper blush to-day methinks because it is made
to dishonor Lee and Jackson, who shall live forever
in the pantheon of history&mdash;as men worthy of
emulation, as heroes whose fame is already written
upon amaranthine tablets.</p>

</div></div>

<p>About high noon Joshua, with his old beaver
caved in on both sides and one skirt of his blue
coat torn away, was seen to oscillate, as it were,
betwixt the whiskey barrel on the Laflin side and
the rum barrel on Hales' side, and doubtless, so
far as his vote was concerned, preserving a strict
neutrality, that is to say, in the plantation language
of the old negro, "Bress de Lawd, I was so
flushtrated wid dat meextry o' rum und sperrits
dat I flung in six wotes fur de cyarpet-sacker und
er eben haf dozen fur de scalyhorg." The result
officially declared, made the agreement between
Joshua and Hales' manager about the payment of
money "arter yo man is dun und lected" a nude
pact.</p>

<p>Laflin was nominated, and in his address to his
constituents flattered himself that the nomination
came unsought and with practical unanimity.</p>

<p>"Our enemies," said he, "shall feel our power,
and you will be asked to co-operate in such manner
as will place you above them in this government.
Can I depend on you?"</p>

<p>"Dat yer kin!" came from a hundred throats.
"Hurrah for de boss! He is de ginrul fur dis kentry,
und he will lick out de white trash! Yes siree!"</p>

<p>Such were the exclamations that deafened the
ear and horrified the sense. Joshua was too drunk
to be offensively partisan. He lay in the street
waving his old beaver hat and hurrahing the best
he could for Laflin, as he held on to "de jimmyjon,"
and singing in a drunken, maudlin way
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>When Joshua got home next morning the sun
was blazing like a great ball of fire from the mid-heavens.
Both skirts of his old blue coat were
gone. His old beaver was flopping and hung limp
and crownless over his right eye, and his old wife
paused in her work in her garden to observe the
dilapidated negro as he approached his cabin. She
could hear him muttering to himself, "Talk erbout
de niggers ergwine ter de conwenshun, und er runnin
dis here kentry, und er gittin de eddykashun
und er bossin de white fokeses, ef ennybody is er
mint ter gin me wun dollar fer my pribileges, I'm

<p>"Ergwine ter sell out, is yer!" exclaimed Hannah
with a grunt.</p>

<p>Joshua looked up startled, and pushing the
broken brim of his old hat from his eyes, he saw
it was Hannah who had interrupted his soliloquy,
and she continued in ridicule, "Yu is too brash,
Joshaway; yer mout git ter be presydent, den

keep er wotin und er wotin, und bimeby yu is ergwine

<p>Joshua saw that his wife was making him ridiculous,
and he slunk away into the old cabin and
fell asleep upon the rickety bed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<h3>MEMORIAL DAY.</h3>


<p>The patriotic men of the South who had so valorously
insisted upon their rights throughout the
deadly passage at arms, felt that now the war was
over, that the country should settle down on the
great common principle of the constitution&mdash;the
principle that had triumphed in 1780. They had
an intuitive abhorrence to confiding extravagant
power in the hands of the corrupt and ignorant.
They could not understand how the Union could
be preserved by the annexation of eleven conquered
provinces, and asked themselves the question,
"Will not the light of these eleven pale stars be
totally obscured by a central sun blighting and destroying
every germ of constitutional liberty?" The
Union, said they, was safe in the hands of President
Lincoln. Rome was safe when Cincinnatus was
called from the plow, but she was torn asunder by
the wars of Scylla and Marius, and history is more
or less a repetition of itself.</p>

<p>Despite the catastrophe that overlaid the South
because of the unhappy issue of the war; the gravity
of which enemies, both domestic and foreign,
have scandalized by calling it "rebellion," despite
the fact that disbanded forces were still prosecuting
their conquests, not against disciplined armies
in the field, but against men, women and children,
in the lawful pursuit of peace and happiness, with
a vengeance hourly reinforced by new resources
and fresh horrors, and with a terror that mastered
our fettered souls; our people felt that there was
at least one refuge from the blast of the tornado&mdash;still
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
a sheltering rock to which they could flee
from the cruel cloud-burst.</p>

<p>In passing the eye rapidly over the outline of
the circumstances in which persecution originated;
in reviewing the cause that unsettled the deep
foundations of social life, the southern people felt
that there were hallowed spots of ground so strongly
buttressed in the hearts of the people that
the violence of the storm could not rustle a leaf or
shake a twig; that these consecrated precincts
they could lawfully appropriate, and as to this
claim, the carpet-baggers with all their hosts of misrule
had the honor, magnanimity and mercy to forget,
forgive and forbear. Here at least there could
be no intrusion, because the baser passions were
fenced upon the outside; and amid this sad continuity
of graves the heart would be uplifted in gratitude
to God, who in his great mercy had given to
the nineteenth century and to the South, such undying
examples of patriotism and valor. Here lie the
bones of men who dared to say, when the political
system of the South was strangely inverted, that
it was such a menace to southern institutions that
it could not go unchallenged; a palpaple violation
of the public faith. To what other convulsions and
changes are we predestined? they asked. Shall we
leave our character, our civilization, our very being
to the unresisted assault and prepare such an epitaph
for our tombs? Shall we declare ourselves
outlawed from the community of nations? "Nay,
war rather to the cost of the last dollar, and slaughter
of the last man." Such was the sentiment of
the men who sleep so peacefully in these graves.
Such was the sentiment of the men, women and
children, who to-day stand over these graves to
honor the brave, and to reproduce a fresh page
in history, and lay it reverently by in our southern
Valhalla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>Col. Seymour was the orator of the day. "Stonewall
Jackson," his old commander, the subject,
and his friends, Judge Bonham and the ex-governor
honored auditors. The old governor, whitelocked
and furrowed, in introducing the orator observed
with a proper decorum. "For what Stonewall
Jackson and his brave men did, we have no apologies
to make here or elsewhere. I had rather wear
here," said he, striking his aged breast, "a scar
from the victorious field of Manassas, than the jewelled
star of St George, or the Victorian Cross."</p>

<p>I can reproduce in a fragmentary way parts of
the patriotic address which I herein give to the
reader, to show that there was "life in the old land
yet."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Comrades, Ladies and Gentlemen:</span></p></blockquote>

<p>"One year ago to-day, with the reverence of a
pilgrim, I stood by the grave of Stonewall Jackson;
and I remembered that every battle order he ever
wrote, every victory he ever won, was a thank offering
to the christian's God.</p>

<p>"I thought, too, of the thousand highways that
rayed out from citadels of oppression, barricaded
with human bones. I thought of the seas of human
slaughter, whose redundant tides flowed on
and on as libations upon the altars of ambition.</p>

<p>"I saw as it were the faded crowns and the
crumbling thrones of dead despots, who once girdled
the earth with a cincture of fire, and marked
its boundaries with the sword, writing again their
achievements where mankind might read and wonder.</p>

<p>"I saw again the accusing throngs of pensioned
widows from the Moselle, the Rhine, the Danube,
the Nile, and wherever else the scarlet standards
of fanaticism flaunted their challenge, hastening
to record their anguish, where the tyrants had memorialized
their deeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"I saw everywhere the badges of speculative
knavery, of incorrigible wrong; Cossacks all, who
knew no law but force, and no patriotism but
greed.</p>

<p>"I thought of the Spaniard, riding to the stirrup-leather
in the blood of babes in the Netherlands;
of the Hun and his proclamation 'beauty
and booty,' and I thought of the angel of God's
mercy proclaiming an armistice; giving a refreshing
peace to the saturated earth after these
monsters were dead, and I bowed with a profounder
reverence at this hallowed grave in the valley
of Virginia.</p>

<p>"I thought then of Alcibiades at Abydos;
of Alexander at Issus; of Scipio at Zama; of Hannibal
at Cannae; of Pompey at Pharsalia; of
Cæsar at the Rubicon; of Napoleon at Marengo;
and I thought, as Vattel thought, that warriors
such as these failed to prosecute the rights of
their countrymen by force.</p>

<p>"I thought of the keen blade of the assassin
that cut in twain the heart of Alcibiades; of the
dagger of Brutus; of the murder of Clitus; of the
hemlock; of the suicide's sword at Thrapsus; of the
assassination at Miletus; of the fifth paragraph in
the will of Napoleon; and then I thought of the
bleeding earth these warriors had scarified and
scourged, until they were drunken with excess of
human slaughter; and then I looked back over the
tide of centuries for a single example of disinterested
patriotism, and I bowed my head once more to
hear a protest from principalities in their orphanage,
and commonwealths in their sorrow.</p>

<p>"I thought again of Jackson, as he knelt in prayer,
when the great guns were signaling the issue of
battle, as with hands uplifted to heaven he was supplicating
his Father to guide and guard his poor
country in her sore hour of travail, and I thought if
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
there were a Pericles somewhere, who from the foot
of our American Acropolis would sound his fame,
the 'bloody chasm' would be bridged by a single
span.</p>

<p>"A little more than three years ago, by the violation
of a plain order, the tears of a nation,
magnanimous and patriotic, rained down upon and
extinguished almost the last camp fire of Gen.
Robert E. Lee. Within that short period events,
like chasing shadows, both clouded and glorified
the perspective of history. Within a like period
of time this great country, by a vigorous discipline,
has completely obliterated lines and boundaries
that once circumscribed the ambition of men. A
trifling order methinks of Jackson, but it cancelled
our charter of freedom, it rendered a nude pact
our declaration of independence. It was only the
nod of the head of an unlettered peasant at Hougomont,
but it sent somersaulting into the sunken
road of Ohain the steel clad cuirassiers of Napoleon
the great; dipped the imperial purple starred
with bees, into the silt of the English channel, and
paragraphed the capitulation of Paris with the
civil death of the great emperor. Such are some
of the pivots upon which great crises rotate.</p>

<p>Forty eight years after the Scotch-Greys pierced
the uplifted visors of the old guard, there glided
down the echoing corridors of time this sententious
order; "Shoot down without halting the
man who dares to cross the lines to-night."</p>

<p>The catastrophe that rode as a courier upon the
flank of this order, hacked the sword, unnerved
the arm that was carving out of a heart of fire a
civilization whose altars and whose shrines were
relumed by the torch of liberty; but the God of
battles, amid the carnage, called a halt. It was a
night of exasperation, of despair. Ten million
people watched, as watchers never watched before,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the last flickering of a life that laid down its all,
at the altar of love and duty. Those ten million
people kept their vigil like vestal virgins, and saw,
alas, the frenzied spirit of hate and wrath snuff
out the candle and heard the groans of the victim
of his own blunder, as he cried out in his delirium,
"Let us cross over the river and rest under the
shade of the trees."</p>

<p>There has been now and again an illustrious personage,
who appears to us to have been mirrored
upon the foreground of events like some titanic
silhouette. The irony of fate has dealt with such
a man, as the creature of an hour, holding him in
thrall in time of peace, to become the storm spirit
in some great crisis. When he dies the face of
history is saddened and obscured, and a twilight
like that observed under Southern skies, falls upon
the world. Such a person may be fitly called
the courier of fate; or better still, the tragedian of
revolution. He cannot be weighed or measured by
the definitive judgment of contemporaries. When
he dies the stride of conquest is checked; sword
blades dripping with human blood are thrust back
into scabbards. In war, he is its inspiration; its
providence.</p>

<p>I make no allusion just now to that splendid effigy
that is yet discerned in the haze that lowers
over Vienna, Berlin and Moscow; that incomprehensible
tutor of strategic science, who with sword
and cannon cut a red swath through the capital
cities of Europe; and partitioned the world into
two dominions, as if he were only dividing in
twain an apple. I speak not of him, whom this
man that "embarrassed God," found a waif, and
made a giant, whose death hastened to its decline
that splendid imperialism that the great Napoleon
erected on the ruins of the commune.</p>

<p>The fall of Stonewall Jackson at Chancellorsville
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
thrust betwixt the Confederacy and independence
a pall so dense, that it could not be cut
asunder with the sword.</p>

<p>I can compare Stonewall Jackson with no hero,
living or dead. He stood in the foreground an
unique personality&mdash;a phenomenon. With the
genius of war he appeared almost supernaturally
mated. Whether his unparalleled victories were the
result of combinations essentially tactical, of methods
logically conceived, or of an intuition that almost
without arrangement forced its power upon
vast evolutions, will perhaps never be known.</p>

<p>The plain profile of this man reminds one of the
hard-hitting, rough-riding Roundhead. His dispatches
smacked of the Calvinism of Ireton and
Cromwell. "God blessed our arms at McDowell yesterday."
Wherever there was a downpour of leaden
rain Jackson and the "Ironsides" would have
been in accord. His was the spirit that resolved
combinations in his favor. His masterly apprehension
of issues diminished the carnage by plucking
the fruit before it was fully ripe. In war as
elsewhere he was absorbed by a fatalism, such as
Mohammedans sum up when they say "What is to
be, will be." Napoleon, like an astrologer, believed
in a star; Jackson, unlike an astrologer, believed
in Him who made the star and lighted it in
the candelabra of night.</p>

<p>A few years ago an American asked a halting,
mutilated soldier of the Old Guard to tell him
how Napoleon died? "The great Emperor dead! He
will not die," was the sententious answer from the
man who had fought under the shadow of his eagles
at Wagram and Marengo. It was with something
of this vague, indefinable superstition, of this
heroic belief in "Old Stonewall" as their providence
that one of the "Old Brigade" would hearken
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
dubiously to such a challenge, "Tell us how
Stonewall Jackson died?"</p>

<p>Critics who have judged with more or less asperity
have said that his capacity as a commander
was limited to the manoeuvres of a corps. Strange
fatuity! A score of battle fields prove the opinion
false. If such had been the case, the history
of Port Republic, Harper's Ferry, Groveton and
Winchester would have been written the other
way.</p>

<p>I saw this imperturbable man at Cold Harbor.
Again he reminded one of the "predestined" leader
of the Ironsides. "If the enemy stand at sunset,
press them with the bayonet." All commands
issuing from him found their climax in this supreme
order. The hero of Toulon never caressed
the fire throated 12 pounder more ardently than
did Jackson. He would have swept every obstruction
from the field with a single battery, or failing
in this would have "pressed" them with the bayonet.
His camp fires are now extinguished. The old
army of the Shenandoah is an aggregation of phantoms.
Winchester, Port Royal, Fredericksburg
and Chancellorsville appear as mirage reminiscences
rather, that steal unbidden upon the soul when
its depths are full of darkness and shadows.</p>

<p>"We walk to-day listlessly over the great,
rough, heroic life of Stonewall Jackson, but on
either side of us are monuments and memorials to
his renown ever brightening to a higher luster.</p>

<p>It is a stern business, this going to war. Reconciliation
is problematical, more frequently impossible.
The public pulse in 1861 was intensely excited.
One boastingly said upon one side that all
the blood that would be spilt, could be wiped up
with a silk handkerchief. Another on the other
side with equal bravado answered that he would
live to call the roll of his slaves from the foot of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Bunker Hill, and thus there was boast and badinage
until the "Anaconda" turned his many-hued
scales to the sun on the 21st of July, 1861.</p>

<p>The scene from the northern point of view was
exceedingly dramatic&mdash;a magnificent host all in
tinsel&mdash;a composite picture of carnival and war. A
flash, as of gunpowder; a blazing up as of dry
heath; a shout ever so frightful, and half infernal,
and the whole universe seemed wrapt in flame and
wild tumult. But the fire has died out; tumultuous
passion is allayed; the old South with its mountains
and glades, rivers and valleys, the stars above
its sodden ground beneath, is still there.</p>

<p>"Jackson believed in the southern cause, as if it
had been a revelation from God. Cromwell said,
'Let us obey God's will' while he whetted his
sword blade to drink the slaughter of women, and
nursing babes at Drogheda. Jackson said, 'Let us
obey God's will,' whilst bringing to the altar the
offering of universal emancipation.</p>

<p>"Jackson believed that the war of invasion was
a heartless crusade against mankind and womankind,
and the civilization of the South, and the
higher law proclamation was the aftermath of the
pernicious broadcasting of seed sown by Horace
Greely, Gerritt Smith, and Joshua R. Giddings.
The old stubble required to be ploughed under,
said they; unhappily in seeding the ground they
scattered here and there dragons' teeth and forthwith
there sprang up armed men.</p>

<p>"Jackson believed that the 'Grand army' in holiday
attire, with flaunting banners and careering
squadrons, were an aggregation of iconoclasts,
fierce destroyers of images, creeds, institutions,
traditions, homes, country. So believed he when
the 'Anaconda' with panting sides drew back to
strike.</p>

<p>"Man to man, bayonet to bayonet, cannon to cannon,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
bosom to bosom, here was challenged the asserted
right of coercion, of frenzy against frenzy,
patriotism, anger, vanity, hope, dispair; each facing
and meeting the other like dark clashing whirlwinds."</p>

<p>Hither sped Jackson with the swoop of the eagle,
down the valley from Gordonsville to fresher carnage,
to a bloodier banquet. Hither he came with
as high a resolve as ever animated Peter the Hermit,
to plant upon the sand dunes of Palestine the fiery
cross; whether right or wrong, cannot now be
known. The formula by which he may be judged
is yet undiscovered.</p>

<p>Eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, and Jackson
with folded arms, occupies the plateau near the
"Henry House." Just beyond is a dark confused
death wrestle. Forty thousand athletes against
eighty thousand athletes; two hundred odd iron
throats perpetually vomiting an emetic of death.</p>

<p>Hope within him burns like a freshly lighted
fagot. There is a quiver in the hardened nerves;
the old sun-scorched cap is in his hand; the lips
are slightly parted; the order given, and the 'old
Stonewall Brigade' is hurled like an immense projectile
upon ranks of human flesh. There is a halt,
a recoil; cannon spit out their fire, their hail, their
death upon bosoms bared to the shock. 'There
stands Jackson like a Stonewall.' Under that
name he was baptized with blood at Manassas.
Everywhere that faded coat and tarnished stars
were the oriflame of battle and the old brigade followed
them as if they had been the white plume
of Navarre.</p>

<p>This incomparable leader never failed in a single
battle from the day when with 2800 men at
Kernstown he held in check 20,000 men and covered
the retreat of the army from Centreville to
Manassas, where he cut their communications and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
decoyed their columns into the iron jaws of Longstreets
reserves. Such achievements were not accidental.
No manoeuvre could mislead the clear
judgment that presided serenely in that soul of
fire. It is not too much to say that the conqueror of
Port Republic was an overmatch in strategy and
technique of war for his opponents.</p>

</div></div>

<p>There were other attractions there, too; flower
girls had brought hither, not the funereal cypress
and willow, but bright and beautiful carnations
and violets, and streaming about the heads of the
throngs were battle flags, torn and tattered&mdash;almost
shredded by shot and shell&mdash;cross-barred with
blue, with pale white stars like enameled lilies
peeping out of the azure ground. Lifeless eyes and
voiceless lips now, had cheered these flags with the
same joy that once greeted the eagles of Napoleon.
Withered skeleton hands now, had borne them at
the head of charging squadrons and battalions,
the guidons of victorious armies&mdash;the guerdon of
a nation's trust and faith. If out of the cold, dead
white stars could come again the old gleam of light
as it lighted up the line of direction over the
mountain passes of Virginia and the valley of the
Shenandoah, what a halo of glory would encircle
Winchester and Gordonsville and Chantilly! how
dramatic the narrative; how truthful the history;
how inspiring the reminiscence; how fully and
completely vindicated the Old South&mdash;the lost
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
cause! But there is no light in the stars, and the
broad bands of blue upon the blood-red field are
disfiguring scars upon the face of an incident long
since closed, and closed forever, full of tragedy
and patriotism.</p>

<p>The old Governor was exceedingly complimentary
towards his old friend, Colonel Seymour, "for
his patriotic address," and very cordially invited
him to visit him at his home.</p>

<p>Alice had formed new acquaintances, and Clarissa
too had honored this most interesting occasion
with her presence. She had carried a basketful of
flowers that had been carefully plucked and assorted
by her young mistress, and with very tender
hands Alice had placed them in a stone urn
at the foot of a grave that seemed to have been
more profusely decorated than the others. Indeed,
it was the grave of the soldier boy who had been
the first to fall in the terrible holocaust of war.</p>

<p>"Miss Alice," Clarissa asked quite feelingly,
"Haint yu dun und fotched back to yo membrunce

strow dese lillies o' de walley on boff on em. Po
fings, I hopes und prays day has dun und gon froo
de purly gates whey dare aint no war, nur tribulation
of sperrets nudder." And the old negro knelt
reverently at the graves and placed the white flowers
upon them. As she rose from the solemn service
she said feelingly to her young mistress,
"Pend upon it, missis, sumbody's bleeged to suffer
fer all dis gwines on epseps dare aint no troof in
proverdense nur grace nudder. Miss Alice, bress
yer life, Gord aint ergwine ter suffer his people ter

speechifying to all dese fokeses."</p>

<p>Alice was not in the humor to indulge Clarissa
in further observations. She was thinking of a
grave over yonder in old Virginia, and wondering
if some fair hand was not arranging the flowers
and tenderly placing them upon the grave of her
boy lover.</p>

<p>The setting sun was shooting little slivers of
gold from its beautiful disc all around the cemetery,
and the shadows from magnolias and weeping
willows were deepening and darkening all the
while, when the Colonel, his daughter and Clarissa
drove home in the old barouche, tired out with the
fatigue incident to the day and its burdens.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<h3>THE BROKEN CRUSE.</h3>


<p>The lights were burning with a soft glow one
night in the mansion when the announcement was
made by Clarissa that a gentleman stood without,
desiring an audience with the old master. The
gentleman introduced himself as Mr. Summers
(half apologetically), a reconstructed rebel. There
was a moment's pause in which, by the shimmer
of the lighted lamps, Colonel Seymour saw that
the visitor was quite an elderly man, without beard
and with soft white hair. His address was easy
and insinuating. He was neatly clad in black
cloth, and impressed Colonel Seymour as being a
man of affairs. Together they entered the library,
the Colonel observing that he conducted all business
transactions in that particular room just now.
Considering the unusual hour at which the visitor
had arrived, in connection with the unpleasant incidents
of a quite eventful day, there was nothing
reassuring in the visit: the times were critical, to
say the least, and his own situation so entirely defenceless,
that he felt as if "vigilance was truly
the price of liberty." So he addressed the stranger
in a manner quite emphatic&mdash;</p>

<p>"May I enquire, sir, to what circumstance I am
indebted for the honor of this visit?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, sir," replied the bland stranger.
"But will you permit me first to ask after your
health and that of your family? How are you,
sir?"</p>

<p>"My family&mdash;that is my wife&mdash;is quite unwell,
sir. She has been an invalid for many weeks, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
I fear there is no possible hope of her recovery,"
said the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Ah, that distresses me greatly; perhaps her
condition is not so bad as you fear. May I ask after
your health, sir?"</p>

<p>The Colonel hesitated for a moment, and then
observed, deliberately, "Physically, I am quite
well, sir."</p>

<p>"Did I not see you, sir, when we were re-crossing
the Potomac on our mad flight from Gettysburg
at the lower ford?" enquired the stranger.</p>

<p>"Mad flight!" echoed the veteran with ill-concealed
wrath. "Have you such a conception of the
orderly retreat of our great army without the loss
of a gun and without the capture of a man, as to
characterize it as a mad flight? Were you a Confederate
soldier, sir, and do you insult my intelligence,
my loyalty, yea, my bravery, sir, by this
challenged inquiry?"</p>

<p>"My dear sir, if the statement pains you I will
recall it instantly. Pray excuse me. I was Major
of the 7th Virginia Cavalry, and as the army halted
at the ford I saw an officer, a Colonel, who was
badly wounded and who with great difficulty sat
his horse on that occasion. I now see that the officer
whom I then saw is the gentleman I now address,
and I heartily crave your pardon for the
rash expression."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," replied the Colonel. "We
are Confederate soldiers again, and will make our
future assaults upon the enemy, if you please, and
not upon Lee's army, that whipped the enemy at
Gettysburg; yes, sir, whipped them and fell back,
sir, because our base of supplies was menaced by
the flooding of the Potomac, sir," fairly hissed the
old man in great excitement.</p>

<p>"My dear sir, why this excessive warmth?" cried
the stranger; "I am sure we understand each other;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
but, my dear sir, the war is over&mdash;why make imaginary
assaults upon an imaginary enemy? We
are entirely in accord. We entered the army because
we then believed we were right, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Knew it, sir, knew it, and know it now, sir,
know it now, sir," fiercely interrupted the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Will you allow me to ask, my dear sir, do you
recall those events with any degree of pleasure?"
asked the stranger.</p>

<p>"Yes, and no. When I realize that then and
now, the enemy with unbounded resources was
eternally casting into the vat of pernicious
fermentation every act, thought and suggestion
that was doubtful in interpretation, and brewing a
concoction as nauseous as the black vomit of the
red harlot herself, and eructating it upon us&mdash;the
recollection is painful; but when I remember
that every sword thrust into their vitals was the
act of a patriot, I delight to recall events that
crowned the old South with undying glory."</p>

<p>"Allow me one other observation, if you please,"
asked the stranger in a tentative way. "Admittedly
the South was right, but, my dear sir, do you
think it possible that men like yourself who gallantly
fought for a cause they sincerely believed
to be just may not impress their individuality upon
an era that promises so much for the betterment
of our condition as a people?"</p>

<p>"Barely possible, I imagine," replied the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Are you inclined to favor a proposition that
has in contemplation the election of negroes to office."</p>

<p>"No sir; such a proposition, in my opinion,
would be so abhorrent to our ideals of sovereignty
that I should consider myself a traitor to the South
and her people. Should I endorse such a proposition,
it would be an act of self degradation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, my dear sir," argued the stranger, "you
will pardon me if I should say that every man
must look out for his own safety. Patriotism to a
great extent, is a matter of sentiment, and a great
man once said 'It is the last refuge of a scoundrel.'
You of course will not yield to such an interpretation,
nor would I ask you to do so, but, sir, we
must let the dead past bury its dead. We must
live in the present, and we must as skilled architects
build for future generations a superstructure
that shall challenge the admiration of men
yet unborn."</p>

<p>"That is to say, if I understand you," interrupted
the Colonel, "you propose to inoculate the
South with the poison of your infamous reconstruction
policy, to engraft upon our institutions
a new and dangerous character, and besides other
atrocious enormities to establish the spoils principle&mdash;its
temptation to licentiousness&mdash;the watchword
to animate your corrupt followers to a savage
and unscrupulous warfare, sparing neither sex nor
age, practicing every species of fraud and hypocrisy,
confounding right and wrong, and robbing
the innocent and virtuous of their only treasure,
their manhood and womanhood. What is your
proposition, sir," he exclaimed vehemently, "but
a proclamation to the venal and depraved to rally
to the standard of a chief, who, like the leader
of an army of bandits, points to our God-forsaken
country, and says to your plunderers, 'This
shall be the reward of victory.' This is no exageration,
sir; disguise it as you may, your proposition
leads to brigandage and ruin."</p>

<p>"But, my dear sir," replied the stranger, "you
have so disarmed me by your arguments that
I fear my mission to you will be without avail&mdash;will
you allow me to proceed, sir? We deplore
the fact, sir, that our most virtuous men are still
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
braving the dangers they might, with a little circumspection
avoid; still plunging headlong, as it
were into great heated furnaces whose doors are
open to receive them."</p>

<p>"How would you advise, sir, that we can protect
ourselves, so we will not be utterly consumed, but
only roasted here and there" asked the Colonel
epigrammatically.</p>

<p>"Ah, you trifle with serious matters" replied the
white haired stranger. "There is one way, sir,
and one way only&mdash;adopt this, sir, and the country
will honor you with its blandishments. Take
the tide at its flood, and co-operate patriotically
with those who are enforcing manhood suffrage
without respect to educational or property qualifications,
and the suffrages of the adult freemen,
white and black, will be cast for you for congress."</p>

<p>"Ah, a tempting bait," exclaimed the Colonel,
"but it has a rancid negroish scent, and the hook
is too sharp&mdash;too sharp sir. Do you intend to do
this thing?" continued the Colonel interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Assuredly, sir," the stranger replied, with
might and main.</p>

<p>"Then sir," shouted the indignant man, "this
interview ends now."</p>

<p>"One more word," pleaded the stranger, "and I
have done&mdash;please bear with me a moment. The
Central Executive Committee, of which I am a
member, feeling their great need of your invaluable
services have commissioned me to make known
to you their earnest desire, that you will accept a
nomination, from the party, for Congress upon
the reform platform."</p>

<p>"You mean your ultra radical platform," suggested
the Colonel.</p>

<p>"No, not exactly that," replied the stranger,
"they desire further, if however you will not accept,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
that you will submit your views upon the
perplexing subject of negro or manhood suffrage."</p>

<p>"And you are sure your committee will act upon
suggestions from me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am quite sure they will," answered Mr.
Summers.</p>

<p>"Then, sir, please ask your committee, as a
special request from John W. Seymour, to put the
negroes to work upon the farms; and the carpet-baggers
out of the state, and hang the scalawags
by the neck until they are dead, dead, dead,
sir."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, tut," exclaimed the old man excitedly,
"you are beside yourself. Remember, my
dear sir, that you are sowing the wind, and by
and by strangers will reap the whirlwind. Good
night, Colonel Seymour, I hope you will think better
of the matter.</p>

<p>As the white haired stranger passed out of the
door, Clarissa, who was closing it after him, enquired
of her old master, "Mars Jon, what nice
farderly ole man was dat ole gemmen? he peared
lak he wus mity sorrowful. Iseed him put his
handkercher to his face lak he mout be weepin;
what did yer say to him, ole marser, dat upsot him
so bad?"</p>

<p>"Without deigning a reply Col. Seymour enquired
of Clarissa what the shouting and halloing
at her house last night meant?"</p>

<p>"Did yer heer dat racket Mars Jon? I spected
yer wus asleep. Twant nuffin epceps Ned und
Joshaway er cuttin up der shines. Dem niggers
been to town und cum bak drunk as horgs in de
mash tub und sed how dat dey had jined de milintery

    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
lan und de mule und de penshun, dat dey wus
agwine to git dern nex Saddy. Lans sake, ole
Marser, I specks we's agwine to have orful times
in dis kentry&mdash;de niggers turned loose lak blaten
sheepses er shullikin und a pilfern erbout ebery
which a way. Ole fokses used to say dat when
de tip eend ob de moon wus rite red lak, dat yer
mout look out fur wars und yurthshaks too, und
I seed dat ur site las nite 'twixt midnite und day
und it fotched what de ole fokses sed rite back to
my member'nce. I'd hate powerful to see any
udder bellion in dis lan, dat I would. Not ef day
is ergwine to shoot steerkyarts und wheel-barrers
clean froo our federick sojers, lak dey dun de last
time. Grate king, Mars Jon, what sorter ammynishun
did dem dare yankeys shoot outen dare

wuz tore to pieces, dey put me in membrunce of
ambylances, und powerful big wuns at dat; Grate

our sojers is ergwine to know pine plank which is
dere'n, und dey drifted disserway und datterway
in de cornfields of Manassy und Chuckkermorger
und de Bulls Run? Grate king!"</p>

<p>Contemporaneously with the coming of the
troubles that were well nigh overwhelming the old
veteran and his beautiful daughter, the death of
the wife and mother came as it were the knell of
doom&mdash;the giving away of the last arch in the compact
fabric of human life, the snapping of the last
filament in the web of destiny&mdash;the leaking of the
last drop of oil from the broken cruse. With her,
the heart could be nerved to extraordinary endeavor;
with her, ever so many bright colors could
be painted upon the angry horizon; with her, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
sunset heavens would diffuse a glamour, all radiant
and glorious, as if the angels were kissing its
banners into crimson and with deft fingers were
garnishing the leaky clouds with prismatic hues;
with her, the little birds upon sportive pinions
would syllable their songs into the dialect of love.
But she was passing away&mdash;passing away like the
shadowy vapor that clings for a moment to the
mountain's crest, like the resplendent star that
shimmers more beautifully as it is dipping its disc
below the western verge, and bids us good night&mdash;like
the breath of the crushed flower that exhales
its aroma for a moment, and is gone. Passing
away from a home that is darkened by shadows,
passing away from the hearts that are consumed
into dead white ashes.</p>

<p>What black stygian waters were rushing vehemently
against the fretted casements of these poor
souls. Ties that are sundering here are binding
into a glorious sheaf loves and affections up yonder,
as imperishable as God's great throne. Passing
away from the frigid griefs that are soon to
environ old Ingleside, when the blood in its channels
is to pause in its circulation, when a negro, vile
and savage lacerates the dear, dear face of her
beautiful daughter, and her precious blood follows
the thorns. Passing away before the proud head
of her noble husband is bowed in ignominy, when
the shackles of a felon encircle arms&mdash;enslave
hands that never struck a blow, except for his
bleeding country. Passing away to plead in her
own glorified person to a merciful Father to speedily
unite the three in the realm of joy, where there
are no shadows and no griefs.</p>

<p>Poor Alice knew as by revelation that the lifeless
form before which she was kneeling and weeping
was not her mother. Oh, what a royal welcome,
what a banqueting upon love there will be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
by and by, when the terrors of the horrid reconstruction
shall so chill her young blood that it
will cease to flow, by and by, beyond the sighing
and the weeping.</p>

<p>Tenderly, yea reverently, the body was placed
into the casket and removed to the parlor, just under
the portrait of her dear soldier boy who went
to heaven from the gory field of Manassas. Friends
had gathered into the room and the man of God
read from the blessed Book, "I am the resurrection
and the life." The solemn discourse was almost
concluded when ruffianly booted feet were
heard in the verandah, and a loud knock was heard
at the door. Armed, uniformed negroes had come&mdash;come
like an Arctic gale, chilling and freezing
heart and soul&mdash;with a mandate to snatch the living
from the dead.</p>

<p>Laflin himself would not have pursued the poor
wretch within the barred precincts of the sepulchre.
The infidel powers of the East would have
paused when they saw this "truce of God." But
there was no order of adjournment in the message
which they brought. "Forthwith" was the unequivocal
command and "forthwith" was now.
They had come to take the broken-hearted man,
though he clung to the casket; come to prod him
with bayonets if the rigid limbs did not respond
quickly to the command, "Quick time&mdash;March!"</p>

<p>Once or twice, through sheer faint, the poor old
man fell out of line and against a black guard who
violently pushed him into line with the imprecation&mdash;</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n yu, git back inter yer place, er I'll stick
my bagonet clar froo yer."</p>

<p>He was arraigned before three white men and
four negroes, and in the presence of whom stood
the white-haired stranger, Mr. Summers.</p>

<p>The Colonel did not clearly comprehend the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
character of the accusation against him. He had
been informed by no one except in a general way.
Perhaps he would learn as he followed Mr. Summers
in his address to this tribunal.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Mr. Summers, continuing his
speech, "whilst it was my plain duty to report
upon the case of Colonel Seymour, I do so with
the hope that he may be given a day to answer; indeed,
gentlemen, I pray that you may not deal
harshly with this old man, who is now in the sere
and yellow leaf. You say that you will require
him to turn his back upon the traditions of the
past&mdash;upon the ancient landmarks; that he shall
fraternize with our party, in fact become one of
us, or his condition shall be made intolerable and
his life burdensome. Spare the rod, gentlemen,
for his sake and for the sake of his only child."</p>

<p>"What have you to say for yourself, sir," asked
the chairman frigidly, addressing himself to Colonel
Seymour.</p>

<p>"Sir, I am an old man. One more turn of your
wheel&mdash;the tightening of the cord ever so slight&mdash;and
a life worthless and burdensome will drop at
your feet. The standard of truth, virtue and patriotism
has bowed its once lofty crest, and is now
prostrate in the dust. All that was beautiful and
lovely in this land of our fathers is sinking, rotting,
dying beneath the blight and mildew of your
accursed lust of power. Why should I survive?
My life, sir, is behind me. You ask me to be your
slave. Sir, your bondage is inexorable&mdash;it is the
life of an outlaw, a traitor, a felon. You ask me
to be your friend, and I should consort with thieves;
I should crucify every principle of a man. You
ask me to be your candidate&mdash;my consent would be
an act of stultification. Sir, against your savage
principles I swear an eternal hatred and wage an
interminable war."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>The feeble old man sank back exhausted into
his seat.</p>

<p>"We intend," exclaimed the chairman with
great deliberation, "to scarify the old wounds of
the rebels until they bleed afresh. Sixty days, sir,
within which to prove your loyalty. You can retire
sir."</p>

<p>Thus ran the order, marked with three blood-red
stars. * * *</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<h3>FREEDOM IN FLOWER.</h3>


<p>Ned, who was now in his seventy-third year, was
drinking to intoxication from the cup the carpet-baggers
had lifted to his lips.</p>

<p>He sat in the shade of a mulberry tree near his
cabin furbishing his musket for the next company
inspection, and stopping now and then to observe
the sportive pranks of a domesticated raccoon.</p>

<p>He heard the irritable voice of his old master
calling him from the verandah of the mansion, and
observed with gravity to his wife&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jes lissen at dat! Golly! to be sho ole Semo

with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Dats de Lords truff" exclaimed Clarissa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Semo, he don't look arter nuffin, dat he

ground to rub his back against the jamb of the chimney,
"De hoppergrasses is avourin de craps, und de

Clarissa, as she stitched the last feather in Ned's
military cap.</p>

<p>"Dare aint but one way fur dat ole man to eber

said Ned.</p>

<p>"Und hows he agwine tu du dat Ned?" interrupted
Clarissa.</p>

und er setlin down und downer twell he kivers
hisself all epseps his two rad eyes, und bimeby

<p>"Ole Mars Jon ain't agwine to flop no whers, dat
he aint," ejaculated Clarissa.</p>

<p>"Den he aint agwine tu git no offis nudder," rejoined
Ned, quite seriously and relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>"Ned, whats yu agwine tu du wid yosef dis arternoon?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Me" asked Ned, "Ise agwine tu scotch mysef
on dis here plank fur a nap, dats what."</p>

<p>"Whats yu gwine to do," he asked.</p>

<p>"Me," asked Clarissa, "I'm agwine tu slabe fur
er nocount free nigger, lak yu, jess lak I has ben
doin fur forty yers, dats what."</p>

<p>"No count free nigger hay! dats a sin to yu
Clarsy, who keeps dat ar pot bilin?"</p>

<p>"Bilin" she asked, in disgust, "Sposin yu lift

dat ar led often dat pot an see whats a bilin, taint
nuffin yu fotched home, I tells yu dat."</p>

<p>Ned distrustfully advanced to the fire place and
lifted the top from the pot and sank back with a
groan, into an old bottomless chair.</p>

<p>"What do ail you, Ned?" asked Clarissa, laughingly.</p>

<p>"Lors a massy, I wudn't a had yu projjeck wid
me dat ar fashun fur a hundred dollars. I wus
skert tu ax yu what yu had in dare, und I kep a
studdin and a studdin, und I kep tryin to smel

as well flung a hundred dollars outen my pocket
into de fire, as to gib me dat ar set back."</p>

<p>"A hundred dollars," mockingly repeated Clarissa,
"How much money has yu had sence de belyun
dun fell?"</p>

<p>"Me?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Yes, you, dats who, how many cents yu had
most fo yer sence freedum cum in de lan, und
yu is as ragged as a settin pefowell."</p>

<p>"Nebber mind," said Ned, "I'm ergwine to git

mule on de hill, und when I flings de whoop

<p>"Ugh, Ugh!" ejaculated Clarissa, "I mout, und

<p>Ned raised his hand to shield his eyes from the
hot glaring sun as he observed, "Tain't nobody
else. Ef dat ar white gal don't hab de tarryfyin

<p>"I wunder whar dat ar gal is ergwine to here at

<p>"Lordy! Lordy! Clarsy," exclaimed Ned, "ef
we uns only hed sum ob dem gud wittles Miss Alice

<p>"Mout hab had gud wittles all dis time ef yu

And Clarissa, overburdened with the tumult of her
tender soul, began to sob and cry.</p>

<p>"Hit nachully tares my ole hart strings outen
my body to sen her dat wurd; kase yu nose, Ned,
dat Miss Alice's hans is tu swete und tender tu cut
de wud fur de kitchen und lif dem hebby pots in
dis yer bilin sun. Ef I had my chusin I wudn't
gib wun stran ob her golen hare fur all de freedum
in de lan, und ole Lincum frowed in, dat I wudn't."</p>

<p>Clarissa could maintain her equilibrium whenever
Ned expatiated upon matters, persons and
events unconnected with her young mistress, but
every chord of feeling in her black bosom was instantly
vibrant with emotion if anything in disparagement
of her was spoken.</p>

<p>Dear, dear child! She was now oblivious to all
that was passing in the little cabin.</p>

<p>There she goes, singing a sweet lullaby, on her
mission of love, moving along in the sunshine that
encircles her as with a magic zone of glory.</p>

<p>The little daisies lift up their heads to laugh as
they whisper to each other, "There she goes, our
little sweetheart!" And an old woman essaying
to free herself from the fetters of the tyrant Death
at the other end of the line is whispering, "Here
she comes, my darling!" Her great, sympathetic
nature, whose capacity was enlarged to embrace all
the poor, white and black, made the black cruel
heart of Aleck, even, unwittingly to relent after
he had torn her fair face with the thorn bush in
the meadow.</p>

<p>When the paralytic, Alexander MacLaren, died
twelve months ago, he bequeathed a redundance of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
squalor and misery to his widow, and now death
in slouching strides was coming toward her little
hut beyond the meadow; coming as if unwilling to
take away the old friend of sweet Alice; coming,
not like the swift cruel messenger, but languidly,
even dubiously; halting to ask if his commission
would permit him to spare her yet a little while
for Alice's sake. There was a footfall upon the
door block; there was the low voice from within,
"Come in, dearie," and Alice and a flood of sunshine
entered together.</p>

<p>"My sweet bairn," the old lady exclaimed, in
the language of the highlands, "how you do gladden
my auld een! Let me kiss you, my lassie, ond
touch your bonnie hair with my auld stiffened fingers.
I want to feel your presence ivery minute."</p>

<p>Alice bowed lovingly at the bedside of the poor
widow and kissed the pallid cheek, and looking
into the faded eyes asked, with heartfelt sympathy,
if she knew who had kissed her?</p>

<p>"Ah, vera well lassie," she answered smilingly.
"I ken nae ane in this puir auld world but you;
And why should I dearie? Do you think I shall
ever cease to love you, Allie, you are sae bright
and trustful; your gentle spirit is like the little
star that shines just yonner when the twilight
deepens into the night, its light ond joy ond comfort
are for some ither fauk, for some ither fauk,"
she repeated with earnestness.</p>

<p>"Oh, I do thank you, Mrs. MacLaren, for such
kind, yet undeserved expressions, they are sweet
dewdrops that are always leaking from a heart,
kind and true," said Alice, as she brought from
her little basket such delicacies as she thought
would tempt the sick lady.</p>

<p>"Now that you love me so dearly," continued
Alice, "will you not take a little nourishment, for
my sake?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"For your sake, dearie," interrogated the old
lady, "thot I will, and thank you with an auld
ruck of a heart thot has but ane love&mdash;all for you,
chiel, all for you. If I live it will be to bless you,
ond if I dee I will whisper to the angels to love
my sweet chiel as I have loved you, Allie."</p>

<p>The old head was very tired and the eyes that
now mirrored another light than that which came
through the natural senses were closing as Alice
sang so tenderly, so softly her favorite hymn; and
it appeared to come fragrant, laden with the aroma
of the heather, with the memories of the gude auld
days from the glades and trossachs.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>The widow lay as though she were dead, so tranquil
was the slumber that had kissed down her
heavy eyelids, and her crossed hands were laid
upon the light coverlid that rested upon her bosom.</p>

<p>"Oh," thought Alice as she looked upon the
scarcely animated human body, "if it were not a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
sin, and if you were not so wearied, how I would
envy you, Mrs. MacLaren; you are soon to be so
happy. Your tired feet will soon press the 'Starry
floor that shimmers in the palace of the King'
ond your tired een will soon 'behold the King in
his beauty,' ond your tired heart will throb with
a divine feeling when He bids you welcome in the
'palace of the King; ond he will gae you the title
to your mansion with a smile, ond you ken fine
it is your ain hoose, ond after sich sae travail you
have coom hame to abide for aye.'"</p>

<p>After a while the old lady awoke to find Alice
kneeling at her head, to wipe the damp from her
brow with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>Alice was the first to speak and she said quite
endearingly "How are you now, my dear Mrs.
MacLaren? I hope you feel ever so much better."</p>

<p>The old lady with some effort raised her eyes
and responded feebly, "Better chiel. Ah my
dearie," she said almost hopefully, "may be I'll
nae go to my ain hame the day. Just then I was
so weary and I had almost forgotten that you were
still with me. Ond were you nae singing a wee
bit ago dearie? or was I dreaming ond heard the
Angels singing, 'We'll trust our God who reigneth
in the palace of the King?' It might have been the
voice of my auld mither, I dinna ken, I dinna
ken," she repeated emotionally.</p>

<p>"If you are not tired, Allie, will you not read a
passage from the blessed book, just to make me
think of the auld, auld story."</p>

<p>Alice took the Bible from the little deal table
and upon opening its pages a five dollar treasury
note of the Confederate government, of the issue of
eighteen hundred and sixty two, fell upon the
floor. It appeared to Alice as a pictorial representation
of war, its havoc, its chariot wheels, with
great cruel tires and knives, and its heaps of slain.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
She turned it over and saw this writing, in a
neat feminine hand on the back, "It was not for
the like of this that my lad was slain at Gettysburg,
it was for honor. With the tidings of his
death came this note from his hands. 'The Lord
gave and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be
the name of the Lord.'"</p>

<p>Alice placed the note back in the Bible with the
thought almost expressed by her tongue, "The
liveliest emblems of Heaven are His saints, who in
the deep sense of anguish can uplift their hearts
to Him in simple child-like faith."</p>

<p>The old lady again expressed herself as feeling
so much better. Poor woman, perhaps it was but
a momentary reinforcement of the vital energy,
that was preparing her for the last interview with
death, when he should come again with shroud and
coffin. "And the Spirit and the bride say come,"
the sweet girl began to read, "and let him that heareth
say come, and let him that is athirst come, and
whosoever will let him take of the water of life
freely."</p>

<p>"The water of life freely, and let him that is
athirst say come," echoed the old lady feelingly.
"Ond all, all, dearie, we shall hae in ower aboondance
in the palace of the King, bye and bye. Ond
wud you mind putting up a wee bit prayer for sich
an auld rack of a body?"</p>

<p>Alice got down upon her knees and clasping the
hands of the sick lady in her own she prayed fervently
that the Father of all mercies would watch
over her charge who had been faithful through
her life; deal lovingly with her, for she is thy
child; be with her now and always to comfort her
and give her that peace which the world cannot
give or take away.</p>

<p>Alice rose from her supplications to kiss the old
lady once more before taking her departure, when
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the invalid, pointing to a little box in beautiful
Mosaic upon the mantel, said to her, "You will
find there a little siller that I have put by for my
beerial chiel, for the gown ond the coffin ond the
grave."</p>

<p>As Alice entered the old mansion at Ingleside
with her mind tranquilized by the experience
through which she had just passed, she heard her
father in quite a loud voice, call one of his old
servants, "Ned, Ned, where is that black rascal
Ephraim?"</p>

<p>"Don't know, mars Jon, came back the answer,
Specks he is dun gone to de baptising in de crick
sar."</p>

<p>"Where is my saddle mare?"</p>

<p>"Don't know dat sar, nudder, specks she's dun
gone wid Ephraim tu sar."</p>

<p>"Where is my new hat and umbrella?"</p>

<p>"Don't know mars Jon, specks dey is dun took
demselves off en wid Ephraim tu sar."</p>

<p>"Who is that banging on Miss Alice's piano?"</p>

<p>"Dey is dem culled ladies sar, Miss Maria und
Miss Susan, er playin high opperattucks sar. I
seed dem er gwine in dere und spishoned dey wur
gwine rong, und I axed dem to play de high opperattucks
some wheys else, kase dis grate house was
too dimmycratuck fur dem, but dey lowed dat dere
daddy had worked fur hit und dey wus hissen und
den I didn't say no mo, kase I wus afeared. Pend
erpun hit, mars Jon, de bottom rail has dun got on
top now sho nuff."</p>

<p>Reconstruction had come with its mildew. Black
cavernous mouths were lapping up the virus and
spitting it out everywhere. Retribution in history
had come too with the evolution of the negro.</p>

<p>The old master like a besieged baron of mediaeval
civilization, was still looking out upon his broad
domains and his cattle upon a hundred hills, but
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
there was rust upon the plow shares, tares in the
wheat, cockles in the rye, and the high noon bell
in its tower hung lifeless and tongueless. No
summons thence to the tired hands and feet
and backs upon the old plantation. Labor was
disorganized&mdash;discipline a dead precedent&mdash;the negroes,
like the swallows and ravens in the old rookery,
homeward and townward as they list, were
pluming their flight.</p>

<p>The many-gabled mansion lay fast asleep in the
Sabbath nooning. A bee-martin, as it leaped to
wing from the neglected meadow, piped a shrill
note or two and scurried away after the thieving
crow; and the interlacing oaks and elms of a century's
growth coquetted with the whispering winds.</p>

<p>Alice felt that she had sustained a mortal shock
when she heard the sound of her mother's piano,
every chord thrilling with strange dissonance; boisterous,
vulgar singing and the shuffling of feet
upon the richly carpeted floor.</p>

<p>She started to enter the room when a rude black
hand was placed with violence upon her arm, and
she was thrust back into the hall, with the remark,
"jess git outen here forthwid. Us ladies is musin
our selfs er makin dis ole fing farly howl. Daddy
ses how dat ef we cullud ladies notices white trash
lak yu is eny mo he's ergwine ter whup us an'
whup us good," and with this they courtesied toward
each other and retired as if they had been
princesses of some black realm.</p>

<p>Alice wept out her indignation in her mother's
room. Poor Alice! Sowing the wind! By and by
what shall the harvest be?</p>

<p>"Ned," called Colonel Seymour, "tell Aleck to
come to me." Ned came back in a few minutes
concealing a grin with his open hand to his mouth.
"Boss," he said, "I seed Ellick, und he tole me
how dat I mout tell yu pintedly dat ef yu wants
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
ter see him wusser dan he do yu, yu mout cum ter
him er let hit erlone udder. Dem wus his berry
wurds." The old man turned away with the wish in
his heart that the black vat of reconstruction might
be heaped up to the brim with the freedmen who
had turned their backs upon their only friends.</p>

<p>As the evening sun was drawing a watery cloud
before its face to shut out, if possible, the degradation
of the white people of the South, Ephraim
rode up at break-neck speed upon the exhausted
mare and as he alighted upon the foot-block he
threw the bridle towards his old master with the
insulting demand, "unsaddle dat beastis Semo,
widout yu wants her tu tote de saddle all her life."</p>

<p>"You insolent scoundrel!" exclaimed the old
man in white heat, "has it come to this?"</p>

<p>"Looker heer, po white man, dus yu no who's
yu er sassin? Ise er spectable cullud gemman, sar,
er franksized woter, sar, und what's yu sar? Po
down white trash. Take yer ole mar und yer ole
umbrill, und yer ole hat, und go ter de debbil."
Thus was slipping away the eventide of the day
that God, in his infinite condescension aeons ago,
had hallowed and blessed.</p>

<p>In the excitement of these almost tragical events
Alice had quite forgotten the sick woman across
the meadow, and she was hurrying there as fast as
she could, when she was intercepted in her journey
by Aleck, who commanded,</p>

<p>"Hole up dar, white 'oman! Whar is yer agwine
wid dat baskit und dem wittles?"</p>

<p>The girl was greatly alarmed at the presence of
the brutish negro in this solitary place and she
spoke as complacently as possible and told him
that she was carrying some food to poor Mrs. MacLaren.
"Will you not let me go on?" she said; "the
poor woman is very ill, and I am sure that I am
doing no one any harm."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes yu is fer a fac, the negro replied with anger,
pears lak yu an yer yo ole daddy is terminated
tu gin de culled genmen all de tribulashun yu kin
und we haint ergwine tu stan hit no longer. Boff
ob yu is jist got tu git outen de grate house und
stop toting wittles tu de po white trash. When
we takes holt ob dis plantashun dey haint ergwine
ter be nary horg, nur chickin, nur pefowell on de
lan und de culled genmen und ladies will be bleeged
to look at tother wuns and suck dey fingers in misery."</p>

<p>As the negro turned away from the affrighted
girl he purposely threw against her fair face, with
a deft hand a thorn switch, that tore the flesh and
caused the cheek to bleed and then laughed with
the gratification of an arch-fiend.</p>

<p>She went on her way in silence but her outraged
spirit could hardly contain itself, and this she said
to herself with burning anger is reconstruction!
A civilization that with whipcords and chains has
suspended law and love and benevolence.</p>

<p>When Alice reached the little home of the widow
she knew that the death angel had entered before
her and was putting his icy finger upon the eye
and the heart, and with an almost inaudible exclamation
of "poor Allie" she passed away.</p>

<p>With tenderness and love Alice arranged the
coverlid over the body and locked the door and
went in search of help to prepare the old woman
for burial. She saw aunt Charlotte gathering sticks
for fuel for the pot that was boiling in her yard,
for it was wash day, and told her that poor old Mrs.
MacLaren was dead. "Will you not go with me and
give such assistance as you can?" "Dat I wont,"
sharply replied the old negress "Ise dun und got
way by any sich drudgery as dat now a days.
When wun ob our siety ceases we has grate
blowin' ob horns und muskits shooting at de
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
grabe und ebery body is as hapy as er rane frog in
de willer tree. Yu sees dem dere bilin cloes in de
pot don't yu, and yu sees dat ar sun ergwine down
as peert as er race hoss, well den Ise got my orders
from Joe und I don't ame tu git a beatin when he
cums home ef I kin hep it."</p>

<p>Alice went on and there were fantastic shadows
here and there in the primitive landscaping of nature
and timid rays of the setting sun were stealing
softly through thorn and bush and bough. She
found Mary Perkins and her younger sister Gussie
at home and she knew that poverty had not destroyed
their kindly natures. She told them with
sadness her mission and when the little assemblage
gathered reverently in the little glebe the
next day and the man of God uncovered his white
locks and looked upon the forbidding pall and
grave, there was a broken column of white flowers
resting over the dead heart of poor Mrs. MacLaren.
"Earth to earth, ashes to ashes," is the universal
requiem of nature&mdash;the proclamation an offended
God uttered when he placed sentinel Cherubim with
flaming swords in Paradise to guard its portals.
It was the voice of the aged ambassador of Christ
this day, when there was no responsive sound to
come forth from the dark chamber hidden under
the clods of the valley.</p>

<p>Alice returned from the burial in a spirit of
resignation, clad in a coat of mail figuratively
speaking, strong and riveted in every joint.
"What sore need for the upbuilding of character
in this degenerate age; when evil is personified;
when courage is so sadly needed," said the girl, "I
will try ever so hard to be pure in heart."</p>

<p>She joined her father in the verandah for a few
moments, and she saw at a glance that the old man
was battling with conflicting emotions.</p>

<p>He said at last very disconsolately, as he stroked
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
her golden tresses. "I had hoped my darling child
to go to my grave in a green old age, but if it
please God to take me and my child I should not
murmur. God knows I am drinking the lees from a
cup full of bitterness. The reconstructionists say
that they are making treason odious and are scouring
the land for distinguished examples."</p>

<p>"Let us not despair, dear father" said Alice as
she threw her arms around the old man's neck.
"You still own dear old Ingleside. Let us sell what
we have and flee ere the whirlwind shall overwhelm
us with evil, I will work for you father and
we may be happy again some day, somewhere.
The good Lord will stay the hands of our oppressors
but let us not wait for that, let us go hence as
quickly as we can."</p>

<p>"You almost unnerve me my dear child with
your eloquence and tears, but that will not do. I&mdash;I
can clean the rust from my old sword and I am
sure it will cut as red a swath now as it did in '63.
Our Scotch-Irish blood is thicker than water.
Never shall it be said by the craven hearted enemy
that John Seymour has ever defiled the proud
lineage of his people. Let us dismiss these unhappy
thoughts and pray at least for our disenthralment."</p>

<p>Monday came and the shadows began to deepen.
The patriarchal oaks and elms were still
bowing gracefully each to its vis a vis.
There was no cook in the old mansion, no
stable boy to feed the horses, and old Jupiter like
the old sexton among the graves was groping hither
and thither abstractedly, perhaps in quest of
memories.</p>

<p>Clarissa the old standby had rebelled, rebelled
against the sovereignty that had been too indulgent
and too patriarchal perhaps; rebelled against
a mistress and a master who condoned every failing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
of her nature; rebelled against a destiny made up
of the comforts of life, without its sacrifices.</p>

<p>You will come back home some fair day Clarissa
and there will be tears in your eyes, there will be
sorrow in your old black heart, and penitence syllabled
upon your tongue. You will come back to
tell your dear young mistress something of the
delusions that made you swerve from interest and
duty and you will see the light of forgiveness in
the pretty blue eyes of Alice.</p>

<p>The message came as it were wrapped up in cactus
leaves. "Tell Miss Alice dat she needn't speck
culled ladies is ergwine to mommick up dey sevs no
mo, cooking wittles fur de white trash. Ned is ergwine
tu git er organ und hosses und kerridge und
she wus ergwine tu split de rode rate wide open er
cummin und ergwine. He's dun und jined de milintery
company und sakes er live dat genmen does
hab de butifullist feathers and buttons und muskit
tu be sho!" Poor Alice in her heart "felt like
one who treads alone, some banquet hall deserted;
whose lights had fled, whose garlands dead and
all but her departed."</p>

<h3>THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW.</h3>


<p>Another morning came and there was a cook
perseveringly tasking herself with a round of slavish
duties in the kitchen; but she did not come
from Ned's cabin.</p>

<p>Old Jupiter, the pet hound, looked up into her
fair face as if to say, "You will not forget me
when breakfast is ready will you?" As quietly as
possible she went about; there was no rattling of
cups and plates, for the new cook said as she came
softly out of her chamber "my dear father must
not be disturbed this morning." She went resignedly
to her toil. There was a blister or two upon
her soft white hands, "but father will kiss the fire
out of them when he comes to breakfast; and then
we will give thanks to God for His bounty and in
our home it may be that we shall be happy."</p>

<p>As her father entered the room, Alice ran to kiss
him, observing that she would not ask for a compliment
this morning, as it seemed that Clarissa
had communicated her mad spirit to all the appurtenances
of the kitchen; the fire would not burn
and the kettle had gone off upon a rampage, perhaps
as Clarissa's carriage would go when driven
upon the corduroy roads of reconstruction; and
then again she had prodded her hand unnecessarily
with the sharp tines of a fork with which she was
marking points in the biscuits.</p>

<p>Her father laughed at her little deficiencies as
he relaxed his stern old face to kiss her and said
to her approvingly "perhaps you will yet be a <span class="smcap">CHEF</span>
in this responsible department my daughter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>Together they sat down to their meal; together
their hearts were uplifted unto Him who had made
for them such ample provision.</p>

<p>"And now my daughter," said the colonel smilingly
as he was leaving the room "what are your prognostications
for to-day. Shall we have peace and
rest, or surprises and?" he had not concluded the
enquiry when a rude knocking came from the hall
door. A frown instantly shadowed the veteran's face.
The hour for inquisitorial visits or interruptions
was unseasonable, "what could it mean?" he
queried.</p>

<p>"Is yo name Semo?" asked a ruffianly negro in
uniform, as the old soldier opened the door "It is,"
replied the colonel restraining his wrath.</p>

<p>"Yu is summuns to kote sar forthwid."</p>

<p>"Why such a requisition, will you please explain,"
demanded the colonel.</p>

<p>"Don't ax fool questions white man; cum rite
erlong, dis heer rit bleeges me to tak yu ded er
live."</p>

<p>The colonel went to the stable to saddle Nelly
and she was gone, Sweetheart was also gone, and
so were the other horses.</p>

<p>He came back with the information; the negro
laughed savagely in his face, and told him "dat de
milintery company was er drillin in de town und
he seed his hosses ergwine to de drill-ground wid
de sargent und de corprul und de flagman."</p>

<p>The colonel looked into the face of the negro as
he asked despairingly: "How am I to obey the order?
I have no way of getting to your court."</p>

<p>"You has got ter go ded er live, I'm er gwine to
gib yu one hour to git ter kote und den I'm agwine
ter fetch yu wid de possum common taters," and
the negro gave his horse the whip and cantered
away.</p>

<p>Sixty-five years had stiffened the joints of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
old man; his muscles and sinews were relaxed and
gouty, but the order must be obeyed; no temporizing
with the policy of reconstruction, no annulling
an order when issued from a court.</p>

<p>The old gentleman halting from sheer weakness
ascended the rickety stairway of the court room
and he saw the power of the law, its learning, its
dignity prostituted to ignoble purposes.</p>

<p>He saw the power of reconstruction, its ignorance,
its venality accentuated to a degree that provoked
his abhorrence.</p>

<p>He saw as he entered the house the American
flag drooping in graceful folds over the bench, and
he felt that judicial authority was reinforced by
the strength and dominion that overpowered the
South.</p>

<p>A stupid negro as black as the hinges of midnight
sat upon the judgment seat; sat there as a
representative of the law that had for its substantial
underpinning in all the bygone ages, honesty,
capacity, promptitude, justice; sat there under a
commission to checkmate evil.</p>

<p>There were but two white men in this revolting
presence, beside the veteran, whose face was now
marked by fatigue and despair, and who dropped
exhausted upon a rude bench.</p>

<p>They were not there from choice but because the
law of the bewildered land had brought them there.</p>

<p>Judge Blackstock's black face looked out of a
canopy as of carded wool; beetling eyebrows of
snowy whiteness would rise and fall automatically
like the crest of a kingfisher; the contour of his
face was made ridiculously picturesque by great
brass rimmed spectacles that sat reposefully below
the bridge of his nose.</p>

<p>A spring tide one day washed him out of a fisherman's
hut into the office of a justice of the peace,
where he was dipping out of his Dutch nets a larger
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
fry.</p>

<p>The old negro was not vicious or malignant, only
ignorant, fanatical and superstitious, with a religious
vein that ran in eccentric curves and sharp
lines through his stupid nature.</p>

<p>Laflin was his apotheosis, his providence, his inspiration.
It was Laflin he believed who had placed
in the mid-heavens the great luminary of freedom;
who had written upon amaranthine leaves the proclamation
of emancipation; and who had erected
within his reach the huge commissariat dripping
all the while with fatness.</p>

<p>It was to Laflin that he carried his docket every
morning to be paragraphed by stars and asterisks
against the names of particular offenders; and it
was to Laflin that he read the judgments of the
court whenever rebels were indicted.</p>

<p>If "Ilderim" the sheik could have seen the old
negro with his mace of office presiding in his court
he would have recognized his maternal uncle.</p>

<p>The black judge retained his office rather by
sufferance than popularity. He was guided by
convictions that were illogical and foolish; slavery
he believed to have been the whipcords of an
offended God with which he smote his chosen
people the negroes hip and thigh. This man
was one of the judges who was caricaturing reconstruction;
inditing as it were a pictorial commentary
of the law of crimes and misdemeanors
in misfitting cartoons.</p>

<p>"Make de pocklermashun, officer" he said to
the negro constable as he placed in his right cheek
a huge quid of tobacco.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," shouted the constable "dis kote is open
fur de suppreshun ob jestis; walk light."</p>

<p>The judge adjusting his spectacles with a judicial
temper, read aloud a warrant. "De state agin Edward
Sanders."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stand up dar prisner; is yu gilty ob dis high depredashun
ob de law ur is yu not gilty?"</p>

<p>"Not guilty," replied Mr. Sanders.</p>

<p>"What maks yu say dat white man?" asked his
honor.</p>

<p>"Because I am not in the habit of lying," replied
the offended man. "Look a heer white man
I aint agwine ter hab no bigity in dis kote," said
the judge as he pointed his long bony finger with
a savage frown at the prisoner, "yer 'nose
dis heer kote is agwin ter mak itsef ojeous und a
pine plank scandle und stinch to dem dat goes agin
de law. Don't dis heer warrant sezs how dat yu
dun und dun dis heer depredashun und now yu

kote aint agwine agin his own affidavy und yu is
foun gilty upon de hipsy dixsy ob dis heer warrant."</p>

<p>"But I beg that I may be allowed to introduce
witnesses who would prove me innocent," exclaimed
the prisoner.</p>

<p>"How in de name ob God is dey gwine to prube
yu innercent when de warrant hab dun und foun
yu gilty? tell me dat" asked the judge argumentively.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to convict a man in your court
who has not been judicially tried," asked Mr. Sanders.</p>

<p>"Say dat ober agin" commanded the judge as he
leaned forward using his open hand as a ear trumpet;
"dis kote don't comprehen de fassinashun ob
de question," and the prisoner repeated the question
with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Eggzackly so," exclaimed the judge, "I sees de
pint; you is perseeding to put dis kote in contempt
wid your obstropuous language; dis kote is gwine
to rite its judgment so de boss can read it widout
his specks. Hit has heerd de state pro und con

und hit has measured out its ekality in golden
stillyurds, and upon de hole kase und de aggrawashuns
dareof yu is foun one hundred dollars
und recognized fur your good behavens fur a year
und a day. Officer," he continued addressing the
negro, "size up dat white man's pile und tak out er
hundred dollars fur de fine fore yu turns him
loose."</p>

<p>"Next case" he exclaimed, "dare is dat Betsy Collins
agin; er witness fur de state agin Mr. Thomson"
he continued deprecatingly, "allus a gittin up
a great flustration agin de po house; a runnin to dis
kote wid arrant lies lak hit was agwine ter trude
itsef on brudder Thomson's feelins."</p>

<p>"What is you doin heer Betsy Collins wid your
rad eye a bunged up lak yu had been a salting a
yellow jackets nest? I'm agwine to pospond dis
kase twell brudder Tompson arrivs in kote und
terryegates de complaint."</p>

<p>"De next case am a forsible stenshion kase I'm
gwine ter let it go by too."</p>

<p>"Grate King" he exclaimed with an unjudicial
gravity, as he bent his spectacled face to peruse a
name upon his docket, "dat ar name retches from
de Rappydan to de Jeemes rubber; Willyum
Abender Dolbery Bowzer Indian Ginrul Mackintosh.
Haint dat name dun und fling yo back outen
jint? I'm ergwine to split hit rite wide open, und
den I'm gwine to wide hit up agin. Mouter node
yu wur er wagrant ur a secesh nigger toting dat
secesh name und all dem Federick gyarments lak
yu wuz de rare eend ob de bellion."</p>

<p>"Whose horg's dat yu bin gitting yo rashuns
offer?" the judge asked with a fearful grin, and
the negro prisoner was for a moment confused,
reassuring himself however he pleaded "not guilty"
to the warrant and asked that his case might be
continued until his old master could be subponed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>The judge looked toward the prisoner with a
scowl as he observed, "What's dat white man's
name?"</p>

<p>"Ole Marser's named arter me," the prisoner
humbly replied.</p>

<p>"Ugh! Ugh!" said the judge "Dats a sarcumstance
agin you. I'm ergwine to put yu whey
dere haint ergwine to be no mo sturbance betwixt
yu and de horgs. Dis heer jedgment is ergwine
to run agin yu twell dat ar horg is fotched
into de kote; und hit is ergwine to run in de name
of de state."</p>

<p>"Grate Jarryko!" exclaimed Joshua excitedly
from among the bystanders, "dat dere jedgment
ez same ez er surcle in de warter, hit haint got no
eend, Grate King! dat secesh nigger hez dun und got
hissef shot up forever und all dun and dun, by und
twixt him und a piney woods rooter that is dun
and woured up fo de bellion fell."</p>

<p>"Dis kote is gwine to rejourn till to morrow
mornin. Make de pocklemashun, officer."</p>

<p>As the old negro judge by the aid of his staff
was shuffling out of the court house the Colonel
was prompted to ask him why he had been rudely
taken from his home and brought as a prisoner
before him. The old negro looked at the Colonel
in a furtive way as he replied irritatingly.
"De kote had to bate de trap wid one warmint ter
catch anudder one." And thus the mountebanks
and harlequins of these outrageous times were
compounding dynamite in their laboratories that
would ere long explode under their feet.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<h3>HOME AGAIN.</h3>


<p>Alice felt that in the afflictive dispensations that
were from day to day scourging the poor south,
that in her own personal trials there was an inscrutable
Providence enacting its ordinances, and
by and by the "end would justify the means."
Great and simple was the faith of this beautiful
child of the sunny south, great and simple her
faith in the unfailing source of truth, love, and
Divine equity. Great was her faith in the possibilities
and recuperative power of a country that
had been scathed so remorselessly by the great
storms of war. She had thrown around her life a
great bulkhead of faith, and she could suffer almost
uncomplainingly, for there was solace in tears
and prayers when her spiritual discernment brought
her face to face with Him who said, "I'll never
leave thee nor forsake thee."</p>

<p>After the arrest of her father she retired to her
chamber for a short communion with her Savior, to
whom she had yielded without reserve a heart
soon to be cast again into the heated furnace of
affliction. She came out of her room to respond to
a feeble knock at the back door, and she opened
it to admit Clarissa. Alice saw instantly that
something had gone wrong with the negro, for
there were great tears standing in her liquid eyes
and her speech was broken and emotional.</p>

<p>"Miss Alice," she exclaimed, amid her sobs with
her black face buried in her apron, "Ole Clarisy is
so sorry, deed she is dat she trod on your feelins,
but Ned he suaded me clare outen my senses, deed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>

'Git outen de way wid de rones, dese heer clay banks

Glang Laflin!' und fo de Lord wun time dat stractified
nigger pearched hissef pon de tip eend ob de bedsted

'wo! wo! wo!' und him plum fast asleep; und
when de fust lite of day cum I heerd him er coaxin

chiss to put de munny in und me und him got into
de steer kyart und dat ole Saltpeter jess turned hissef

hosses, und day er straying disserway und datterway
twixt de norf and de souf und he lowed dat 'nobody
cud hit de rite rode all de time kase de bellion

Alice; und den I got er studdin erbout ole Marser und

slave fur yu und ole Marser twell I die; twell de
ark angel stretches out his whings and taks me ter
rest in his busum. I know I was a stracted fool
when I drapped the kitchen key under de do, but
bress your hart Miss Alice dar is sich a flustrashun
all ober de land, de niggers lak ragged ruffins ergwine
to de town und cummin back agin, er gallipin
hosses und er blowin great big horns pine blank
lak dam yaller mornin glories, dat I is so pestered
dat I don't know de fo eend ob de grate house frum
de hind eend." "Is you been in de kitchen dis
mornin Miss Alice?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," replied Alice, "and everything is tidy
and clean."</p>

<p>"Is!" ejaculated Clarissa. "Well I'm ergwine
in dar und cook ole marsa sum good wittles fur I
knows he ergwine ter be most perished when he
comes. Po ole marsa; it do pear lak he is suckin
sorrow all de bressed time; to be sho dis wurrull is

pearch upon de tip eend ef de chimney und see de
ruinashun of dis po souf he wud'nt flop his whings
but wun time fo he wud be clean outen site, dat he
wud'n't."</p>

<p>The coming back of the truant servant was a
bright page in the life history of Alice. She had
been so sad, so lonely, so forsaken. She had looked
into the arching sky and saw nothing there but
frowning clouds; she had introspected her poor
heart and there was nothing there but the pictures
of the dead; she thought of her friends and saw
only grinning phantoms. Still sowing the wind
and sowing, sowing, came back the echo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>She went into the parlor and seating herself at
the piano thrummed its neglected chords, and was
ever music or song so enrapturing. Surely an invisible
choir supplemented her sweet voice. She
arose from the piano and knelt at the little altar
to pray for her father, who was at that moment in
the hands of these merciless people; who like Huns
and Vandals were riding rough shod over the south
arresting arbitrarily the aged men whose learning,
experience and virtue had illustrated its civilization
and given impulse and direction to its grandeur
and glory. She was pleading with Him who
had permitted his chosen people to be scourged by
the lashes of the Egyptian task-masters; pleading
not for her life but for another life, that like the
wasted candle would flicker a little longer and go
out. Alice then went to the kitchen and found
Clarissa burnishing the tea service.</p>

<p>"Bress yor hart, young missis," Clarissa said
"you allus cums lak a streak o' sunshine. Ef de
clouds was a drapping rain all de time I cud see de
bressed sun er shinin when yu'se erbout."</p>

<p>"I thank you Clarissa, but I don't deserve your
compliments," Alice replied. "I don't feel as if I
could cheer any one or make one human heart light
or happy. What will they do with father Clarissa?"
she continued.</p>

<p>"De good Lord in heaben only knows, missis.
Pears lak dey ez wouring dat po man up wid leetle
moufuls at de time, and he so innosen too."</p>

<p>"Poor father," she said to herself. "I have been
made very strong by a refreshing influence. If you
could only place your burdens upon me until I became
wearied like yourself, I would be so happy."</p>

<p>At twilight the old man, foot sore and exhausted,
tottered into the verandah very much in the spirit
of Cataline "nursing wrath and breathing mischief."
"How uniform in all ages," he vehemently exclaimed,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
"are the workings of tyranny; how plausible its
pretexts; how detestable its purposes! I have
thought of death and felt no fear when I invited
him to come and to come quickly; but I beseech
the great God now that he will spare me to behold
my people rising in their majesty, with a constitutional
exercise of their power, to expel these
barbarians from the country; to preserve our laws,
our peace, our humanity; and to sustain the liberties
of the people against the imminent perils to
which they stand exposed."</p>

<p>He knew that he was powerless against that
oppression that lacked every resource of intellectual
vigor; he knew that whatever indignities were
offered to person or property were condoned or excused;
he knew that the manhood of the South
was suffering a social attaint.</p>

<p>He told his daughter as best he could his humiliating
experiences with interjections and volleys of
wrath; how that when he was confronted by a
black savage in the court he was told with fiendish
laughter that the officer "had fotched the
rong man," "dat de state had no charge agin him,
but it mout hab fore he lef de town." Scarcely had
the clear sun begun to overlook the trees the next
morning when the negro officer again presented
himself at the door with a requisition for Mr. Seymour.</p>

<p>"Yu is ordered ter kote ergin," the negro demanded.
"The jedge sed how dat he made er mistake
yestiddy und sent de rong man ter jail."</p>

<p>"Let me see your warrant," Colonel Seymour
sternly asked.</p>

<p>"If yu fetches a witnis I'll read de warrant,"
the ignorant brute replied.</p>

<p>Clarissa who was dusting the furniture in the
hall, overhearing an animated conversation between
her old master and the negro officer, peeped out of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the door when the negro saw her and commanded
her to come to him.</p>

<p>To go or to run, that was the question with
Clarissa, but she made a virtue of necessity and
timidly obeyed the order.</p>

<p>"Hold up your right hand, yu po nigger trash,"
the negro exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Oh Lordy, Mr. jedge, what has I dun und dun?"
cried Clarissa; "Ergwine to de jail house fur nuffin
in dis wurrul, me und ole marsa; und what is ergwine
ter cum ob miss Alice?"</p>

<p>"Hole your old mouf, I haint ergwine ter hurt
yu. Stand rite dar as de witnis und den you is
deescharged," and with that he took from his pocket
a dirty yellow paper and began to spell out its
contents.</p>

<p>The officer patronizingly remarked to
Colonel Seymour as he was seating himself in the
buggy, "I can gib yu er ride to de kote ef yu will
excep of my sability." The Colonel thanked him,
for his gouty joints were rebelling. By a cruel inexorable
law of gravitation the old man was sinking
from the level of a man to the condition of a
slave. Alighting at the court house he was mortified
to see a white man and a negro handcuffed together
walking in the court room, in the custody
of another negro officer. As he walked toward the
black judge, a score of brutish negroes cried out
"Yander is dat ole secesh, he'e ergwine to git jestis
now."</p>

<p>"Fetch Mr. Seymour fore me, sar," commanded
the judge; "whar is squire Wiggins und his affidavy?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Seymour, yu is scused of interruptin de
squire heer in de joyment ob his social pribileges,
and dis kote has found yu gilty. Let dis prisner
be found er hundred dollars und ef yu
haint got dat much munny handy, de kote will
change de jedgment und send yu ter jail."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>The Colonel had no difficulty in finding a friend
who advanced for him the amount of the fine and
he sought the carpet bagger Laflin to ask his protection
against future indignities. The name Laflin
stank in the nostrils of an outraged people.
This free rover of reconstruction was shameless
and conscienceless; the marplot of every conservative
sentiment conceived for the betterment of the
people; a human ogre with but one eye that fixed
its stare upon the dollar whether enveloped in a
tattered rag or a silken purse. The Colonel saw
this man as he was coming out of a low groggery
arm in arm with negroes. "Can I speak to you
sir?" he replied.</p>

<p>Laflin turned fiercely upon him with the interrogatory.</p>

<p>"Who are you sir, and what is your business?"</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Seymour, and my business is to ask
your protection."</p>

<p>"Ah indeed, you are the rebel who has been
giving our people so much trouble." the brute
replied.</p>

<p>"I am sure you do not wish to annoy an old man
who is trying to live peaceably at home."</p>

<p>"Yes. I do sir, and I will hear nothing more
from an infamous villain like you."</p>

<p>"My people white and black have my authority
to do as they will; to insult and assault rebels and
to make reprisals whenever they think proper."</p>

<p>Thus day by day the uncrowned satraps were
collecting material for the coming carnival of vice
and crime.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<h3>A KNIGHT OF THE WHITE CAMELIA.</h3>


<p>At early dawn in the language of the excited
servant, "Dere is sich a flustration agwine on outen
old misses flower gyarden as I never seed in my
born days."</p>

<p>With this exclamation her young mistress was
aroused from her slumber by the old negro as she
knocked violently at the door of her bed chamber
in a state of great perturbation.</p>

<p>"Fur de land sake! Miss Alice if yu wants to
see a sho nuff harricane run outen here as peart
as yer ken. De stracted niggers big und leetle has
finely tuck de plantashun. Oh my sole, de heabens
and de yearth has cum togedder!"</p>

<p>Alice rushed to the window and was horrified at
the sight before her. She heard a jargon of boisterous
defiant noises graduated from inarticulate
sounds to higher and varying keys with occasional
snatches of a disgusting song in falsetto.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We de bosses is er gwine to be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kase ole Lincum dun set us free,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In de year of Jubilo."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She saw to her disgust and mortification a score
or two of negro children romping like cattle
through her sainted mother's flower garden. They
were plucking the dahlias and roses and other varieties
of flowers with ruthless hands, and blowing
their petals hither and thither with their vile
breath into the air. Such desecration was never
dreamed of by Alice and she spoke angrily to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
disgusting little vagrants and attempted to drive
them from the premises.</p>

<p>"Yer jes shet yer ole mouf, dats what, ole po
white trash. Us yung uns haint eben er studdin
you. Is us Maria?"</p>

<p>"Dat us aint," pertly responded Maria. "Yers
ole po white trash, dats what my farder and my
mudder ses you is, and us cullud ladies haint ergwine
to mess wid you nary bit und grane. Us is
agwine to pull all dese ole flowers und fling em on de
groun, und us aint er skert of nary ole skeer-crow
lak yer is nudder."</p>

<p>And with these sundry and divers exclamations,
Maria and Susan joined hands and danced a
break-down upon the flower beds, while the
other negro children big and little clapped hands
and sang in shrill piping notes another stanza of
the song.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"De bellion it is dun und fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Und ole Marsa is gon to&mdash;well,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In de year of Jubilo."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Alice attempted again to drive them away with
her father's cane, when they aligned themselves in
positions of attack, and with brick-bats, fragments
of slate and glass and other weapons of improvised
battle challenged in angry volleys.</p>

<p>"We's jes dars yu to put yer ole foot outen dat
do und we'll mash yer hed wid er brick," and
with that one of the missiles went crashing
through the imported plate glass of the front
door, when the wicked vermin scampered away
with the warning cry.</p>

<p>"Dey is er cummin, Dey is er cummin, looker
dare, looker dare," and hid around chimney corners
and among the brick underpinning.</p>

<p>Clarissa had viewed proceedings from the window
of the kitchen with as much interest as though
it were a battle of real blood and thunder, and running
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
out of a door around a corner where she saw
the kinky head of "Sofy Ann" peeping, she seized
her by her hair and soused her over head and ears,
in a hogshead filled with rain water that stood
near the kitchen "Fo Gord!" she exclaimed, "I
don't know whedder to drown yer outen out ur to
baptize yer hed fomost. I'm gwine to wash offen
yer sins ef I nebber duz no mo," and she kept
ducking the little nigger until she was "moest
drowned sho nuff." "Dar, now, I'm agwine to
turn yer loose dis time, yer imp of Satun; jest let
me ketch yer wun mo time in ole missis flower
garden lak er hoss wid de blind staggers, und yer
fokes will hab to sen fur de crowner. Take yersef
clean clear outen my site, yer pizened varmint."
The little negro, blubbering, spitting, coughing
and bellowing, sneaked away toward the office
looking back with savage glances, with eyes that
stood out like a lobster's.</p>

<p>At this point of time the sound of wheels was
heard down the roadway and going to the door
Alice saw a lady of uncertain age with a very keen
aspect, smartly dressed, alighting from a road cart.
As she was approaching the door Alice at once
recognized her as the lady who accompanied Mr.
Jamieson, the Englishman, to the mansion only a
short time before and whom that gentleman had
addressed as his niece.</p>

<p>"Will you give me the key to the office, Miss?"
she asked pertly addressing Alice.</p>

<p>"Now, dearies," she called to the negro children
who had gathered suspiciously around her, "Just
go to the schoolroom; I will be with you directly."</p>

<p>"Will you give me the key to the office Miss?"
she asked this time with much emphasis.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I have no control over the office, it is
my father's, madam, and he has his books and
papers in it and doesn't wish them disturbed."
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
"My father is not in the house just now. Perhaps
you had better wait until he returns."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed, miss, I carn't, I am a bit late just
now, and I must be prompt, miss, or I shall lose
my position. It doesn't matter about your father's
books and papers, miss, that is a trifle; I guess I
can find a place for the books and papers if you do
not choose to remove them yourself. Get a move on
you, Miss, if you please, as I remarked, I am a bit
late this forenoon."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to give you the key, madam,"
again replied the girl, "What is your business upon
my father's premises unbidden?"</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed, what impudence! Did I ever, I
guess you will find out quickly, miss! Will you
give me the key miss, or shall I drive home again
and report you to Mr. Laflin?" The name Laflin
was, figuratively speaking, the burglar's tool that
unlocked every door in this populous county.
With many wicked thoughts Alice delivered the
key to the schoolmistress and with her arms
around the necks of two negro girls she trooped off
to the office; the door was opened and into the
room the mistress and pupils entered.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, dear, dear! exclaimed the school
marm piteously. Whatever shall I do with all
this rubbish? Come here, dear gyurls and boys, be
a bit lively and remove these disgusting old things.
Take them to the lady of the house; I guess she
will know what to do with them. We carn't have
thes trifles in the school room; no indeed we carn't"
and pell-mell, helter skelter, topsy turvey, books,
periodicals and papers were thrust out of doors into
boxes, barrels, anything, anywhere as if they
were so many burglars "taken in the act."</p>

<p>Poor Alice cried and sobbed; but a new regime
was fast crowding out the memory of the olden
days, it was the welding of an intermediate link
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
between the waning and the waxing&mdash;the disappearing
and the appearing civilizations.</p>

<p>"Now, dear gyurls and boys," said the mistress.
"Take your seats. I guess we will begin. Charlie,
come here, dear. You are a sweet little boy and I
guess your mamma thinks so, too. How old are
you, dear?"</p>

<p>"Seben, agwine in leben," answered the little
black urchin quickly.</p>

<p>"Who made you, Charlie?"</p>

<p>"Who made me?" repeated the little negro saucily.</p>

<p>"Yes, who made you?"</p>

<p>"Oh I dunno, dat dere boy dere sez ole satan
made me und him too."</p>

<p>"Oh, the precious little heathen," exclaimed the
school marm, discouragingly, "Did you ever hear
of God?" she asked again.</p>

<p>"Yes mum, I dun und seed him wun time, when
me und Jake wus a rabbit huntin."</p>

<p>"Oh dear, dear, dear! Where did you see God?
And what was he like?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Seed him down de crick," answered the negro
smartly.</p>

<p>"What was he like?"</p>

<p>"What wus he lak?" echoed Charlie, digging into
his pockets with both hands and standing upon
one barefoot. "Lak a jacker lantern cum outen de
groun."</p>

<p>"What became of him?" asked the lady.</p>

<p>"What cum of him?" asked Charlie "He flewed
clean erway," answered Charlie as smartly as before.</p>

<p>"Oh my dear, dear, child, what is to become of
you!" she exclaimed disparagingly. "Susan, come
here, my pretty gyurl," called the lady. "Oh!
how pretty are your sparkling jetty eyes," she exclaimed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
as she turned up the little negro's face to
kiss her. "Now dear, how old are you?"</p>

<p>"Me!" asked the girl, "I's furteen gwine in foteen."</p>

<p>"And now tell me who made you?"</p>

<p>"Who made me!" echoed the child. "Oh, I fort
yu axed dat ar boy who made him," she answered
with a broad smile.</p>

<p>"So I did; now I wish to know who made you?"</p>

<p>"I aint no kin to dat ar boy, kase his daddy aint
got but wun eye und my daddy has got too eyes."</p>

<p>"Who made you, child?"</p>

<p>"Ho, I furgot," replied Susan "Gord made me."</p>

<p>"That is correct," answered the teacher, "Now
what did God make you out of?"</p>

<p>"Outen?" again replied Susan, "Oh, outen lasses
candy. My mudder says kase I's so sweet."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear, dear, shall I give entirely up?" exclaimed
the discomfited lady. "Shall I try again?
yes, perhaps I shall find a little leaven directly."
"Come here Willie; I can see from your bright
face that you are a smart little boy. Now tell me
did you ever hear of the rebellion?"</p>

<p>"Belliun?" echoed Willie as he thrust his fingers
into his mouth and out again with a pop that made
the children titter. "Neber heerd ob nuffin else
epseps de belliun."</p>

<p>"What is a traitor, dear boy?"</p>

<p>"Tater?" "What sort er tater, sweet tator ur
Orish tater?" enquired Willie.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may teach the little heathen to understand,"
said the school marm, suggestively.
"Willie," she asked "What do you call that gentleman
who lives in that fine house over the way?"</p>

<p>"Calls him!" again repeated Willie, "I calls
him po white trash; what dos yer call him?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear, dear, dear," screamed the teacher
utterly bewildered. One more time she exclaimed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
"James, come here," and another little negro as
black as tar with one eye closed by a great knot
upon it came forward. "What is the matter,
James, with your face?"</p>

<p>"Umph!" grunted James, "Specks if yer seed
whar I been you'd know 'dout axin. Dat ar boy
has been scrougin me lak I wus a trabball."</p>

<p>"James, if you are a bad boy do you know where
you will go when you die?" asked the lady.</p>

<p>"Umph," exclaimed James, "I haint eben a studdin
erbout which erway I'm a gwine arter I die.
I'm studdin which erway I'm ergwine arter I git
outen dat ar do. See dat ar boy a shaking he
hed?" "He sez how dat ef I cum by his mudders
house agwine to my mudders house he's agwine
to scrouge me sum mo, und I'm skeert to go
tuther way."</p>

<p>"One other question" (half aside), "James, if you
live to be a man what are you going to do for a living?"</p>

<p>"Gwine to do?" said James, "I'm agwine to be
a lyer, so I kin set in de kote house und sass de
jedge." And thus the farce went on day after day
under the shadow of Ingleside.</p>

<p>Clarissa caught a depredating urchin trying to
stand upon his head in a half-filled barrel of crushed
sugar in the pantry and said to herself "You
stays dar twell I get me er plank," and creeping
like a cat back again, and taking a fresh purchase
on the board, she came down upon "de middle
ships of dat dar ar yungun lak er buzzum of struction;
pend upon it, Miss Alice, dat ar niggar is er
flying twill yit wid sweetnin nuff to last twell de
July flies cum agin."</p>

<p>"This nest of dirt-daubers," as Colonel Seymour
fitly described the school, became a nuisance that
must be abated by hook or crook. The law
was nothing more than a great stalking shadow.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
"If I could only secure the services of Jake
Flowers the regulator, thought the old man,
"he and I shall be a law unto ourselves."</p>

<p>This was the man whom Colonel Seymour desired
as his file leader upon the drill ground when the
stalking shadow of the law failed to keep time to
the music, a law unto himself, whose forum should
be "thar or tharabouts" on the Ingleside plantation.</p>

<p>Jake Flowers the regulator had violated a law of
the Sabbath by working out some devilish invention,
which, he observed with satisfaction, to his
wife, would keep the coroner sitting upon corpses
until "the craps were smartly out of the grass."
The regulator stood in the open door, looking out
upon the great sheets of water that were falling
from the clouds. As he stood in his muddy boots,
with both hands deep down into his pockets, his
carrotty hair in great shocks standing out of a
crownless hat as if an electric current had just
passed through it, he was picturesque in the extreme.</p>

<p>"Sally Ann!" he exclaimed "I am thinking."</p>

<p>"Well, think agen," Sally Ann answered tartly,
"That mout fetch back old Nance and the biddies."
Sally Ann had been pouting ever since
Jake went to jail for the loss of her setting hen
and the chicks.</p>

<p>"You haint got no call to go back on me, on the
occasion of the old hen and the nigger," said Jake
seriously. "Hit wus providence or hit wus the
guvement, and twixt the two they has got a mighty
prejudy agen a poor man; when hit comes ter
shullikin and pilferen they is hard to hender.
Weuns haint no more than dandy-lions in the
path of the harrycane; leastwise weuns kaint hit
back.</p>

<p>"Nor hit haint providence; nor hit haint the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
guvement, nor hit haint prejudy," Sally Ann replied
angrily "Hit are pine blank cussedness. Some
folks is onnery Jake, and it is like the swamp-ager,
hit is powerful raging when the crap is knee-deep
in the grass. I shouldn't wonder nary bit and grain
if Andy's crap aint in the yallers same as ourn."
This was said very provokingly, and Jake felt the
sting of the reproof.</p>

<p>"Jeminy-cracky!" he exclaimed in a passion,
"Harkee Sally, hit is tit fur tat; be ye a pinin
fur another fellow?"</p>

<p>"Why I guess maybe&mdash;I reckon&mdash;I mout assist
yu'uns, leastwise I haint a going to stand in yu'unsway."
The regulator looked down as by accident
into the cradle: there was the sleeping babe, the
pledge of a love that had been hedged in all these
days by privations, and his heart went out toward
his wife with the old time affection.</p>

<p>"Naw Sally Ann" he exclaimed with a husky voice,
"Weuns kaint part when there is no one to come betwixt
us; weuns kaint say good-bye twell yuuns is
on yon side of the river."</p>

<p>The roses had faded out of the cheek of his
wife, but there was the old-fashioned sparkle in
her eye; there was the old time love in her heart,
crossed sometimes by the perverse nature of her
lord and master.</p>

<p>"Haint you made your will Jake?" asked Sally-Ann
half seriously.</p>

<p>"Naw is you skeert honey?"</p>

<p>"Andy has done and made hissen and fetched it
over here to read last Sunday when you wus gone
to the mash and hit read like scriptur."</p>

<p>Jake had been envious of Andy Vose for some time.
When the need of the country for men good
and true had been most urgent, Vose had deserted
to the ranks of the enemy, and now he counted his
flocks and herds by the score. Jake was also jealous
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
of the attentions the scalawag was from time to
time showing his young wife; these visits occurred
most frequently in the absence of the regulator,
and these intrusions as he felt they were, gave
him alarm. After reflection, Jake concealing his
suspicions remarked with apparent unconcern,
"Read like scriptur, I'll be dorg gone!" "I haint
got no call to make a will like Andy, honey. De
nigger officer levelled on old Nance and the biddies,
and the live stock has run plum out epsepting the
babe and it is yourn any way honey."</p>

<p>This man was a terror to the freedmen. They had
a tradition among themselves that the very last seen
of the regulator until after the war was over was
his ascension in a cloud of fire and smoke into "de
elements" holding fast to a dead negro. Jake said
that this was "pintedly" true, but that he came
down again as his captain was going up who told
him when he had fairly lit to "charge bagonets." In
the language of the plains this Jake Flowers was
an "eye opener." His personal attractions he said
had been spoilt by the blamed war. I am not sure
that the name of Jake Flowers appears upon the
bloody roster of battles lost and won; but for his
doings at the Crater fight, so Jake has observed,
historians would have reversed the incidents of
that bloody day.</p>

<p>He claimed always to be the "Survival of the
Fittest" and with the blind faith of the Moslem he
believed that there was a "Providence that shapes
our ends, rough hew them as we may."</p>

<p>His favorite posture whenever animated was as
follows; he would sit with his right leg crossed
over his left, gently swaying his foot, with his
bearded chin resting reposefully in the palm of
his hand, with the fore and middle finger forming
the letter V and pressed to his lips; through which
he would now and then expectorate; the man was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
also spavined in the right knee joint that caused
him to walk like a sailor on his "sea legs." Like
other men he had his delusions and whether good
or evil, they were the rule of action of his life.
Jake was the reinforcement vehemently demanded
in this conjuncture. "With the regulator armed
and equipped, the enemy will flee without taking
order as to its line of march," thought the old man.</p>

<p>"I am utterly bewildered; can you help me Mr.
Flowers to drive these vermin from my home?" he
asked the regulator.</p>

<p>"Wall, now," drawled the regulator, "I reckon I
mout ef I am not pestered ur nuthing; which eend
do yer expect me to take holt of?"</p>

<p>Jake gave an extra motion to his spavined leg
and looked up quizzically into the rigid face of the
old man.</p>

<p>"Clean them out sir, root and branch, if you
will, sir!" exclaimed the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Prezactly so," ejaculated the regulator, "Prezactly
so," he reiterated. "Does yer mean it pine
blank, mister?" he again asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, emphatically I do," responded Colonel
Seymour.</p>

<p>"Drat my buttons if the thing haint done and
did!" the regulator answered with emphasis and
taking his leave observed, "I'll see you later, mister."</p>

<p>"If I kin regulate this kentry as it had orter to
be did, there wont be a biggerty nigger twixt here
and Filadelfy," and he passed into a little copse
of woods that skirted his own humble domain.</p>

<p>The autumn days had come&mdash;Nature was preparing
a more elaborate toilet in her great boudoir&mdash;replenishing
her exhausted stock of aromatics
to besprinkle the fields and forests, the glades and
the hills; painting the leaves with irridescent tints
and even the sky with a mellow, refreshing beauty;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
and in this excess of toil. Alice saw the handiwork
of Him who holds in the palm of His hand this
great sphere.</p>

<p>She looked upward to the twinkling stars and it
seemed to her as if God had relumed the heavens
with a brightly diffused glow of love. God the
Creator and man the creature&mdash;the Sovereign and
the rebel, brought into apposition with each other
through the supernal harmonies of His universal
realm.</p>

<p>But the child was sad this beautiful October
night. The birds were nodding quietly in the old
rookery; there was no music in the air, for the
winds under a coverlid of emerald and amber and
carmine had gone fast to sleep in the trees, and
the tintinnabulation of the little bells in the meadows
had ceased altogether.</p>

<p>"If I could whisper to the stars what I would like
to have them know of my unhappy life they would
sympathize and perhaps they would whisper back.</p>

<p>"Poor forlorn child! How we pity you!"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow," she said reflectively, "I shall be
twenty-four years of age, and oh, how all encompassing
has been the evil. Every picture that
glides athwart my heart is broken: every idol that
I have fondly loved is nothing more than an effigy.
Delusions follow delusions; what is life but a burden?
If we look forward there are demons: if we
look backward there are coffins."</p>

<p>The poor wearied girl, sad and without hope, fell
asleep in her mother's chair as softly as if the angels
were rocking the dear old chair and singing
the old nursery lullabies; they must have kissed
her heavy eyelids down; so profound, so tranquil
was her slumber.</p>

<p>When she awoke the little birds were singing as
cheerily all around her in the magnolias and oaks
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
as if their little tongues were touched with the
spirit of her happy dreams.</p>

<p>The cloud that overcast her face was gone and
she went into the kitchen where Clarissa was absorbed
in her duties.</p>

<p>Clarissa exclaimed as she entered the kitchen,
"Miss Alice, whar in de name ob commun sense
has yer been all dis time? Here I's been a cummun
and ergwine, a ransackin dis house high and low
fur yer. Didn't yer heer me callin yer, missis? I
spishuned yar wus in ole marser's room fast
asleep."</p>

<p>Alice was obliged to confess, a little shamefacedly,
that she had fallen asleep in the little alcove in
the verandah and had slept so soundly that she
heard no noises until awakened by the twittering
of the birds in the over-arching bower.</p>

<p>"Sakes alive, missis," exclaimed Clarissa "sum
ob dese nites a grate big snake is ergwine to drap
rate down into yer lap und sting yer moest to def.
How dos yer feel missis arter dis toxication?"
the negress asked solicitously.</p>

<p>"Quite well, I thank you, Clarissa, my sleep
was ever so refreshing," replied Alice smilingly.</p>

<p>"What does yer fink dem pizened yung warmints
dud and dun yestiddy? Yu knowed ole
Bob Sal, dat ar ole fafeful mousin cat of ourn?
Whar yer fink I foun dat po ole cat, missis?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I do not know, Clarissa, I hope the
negroes have not hurt him," answered Alice.</p>

<p>"Deed they has too! Drowned to def in de hogshead,
wid a brick tied erround him. Dey is de
outdaciousest yunguns I ebber seed in my born
days. Dere haint no telling what dey has dun
und gon und dun to dis heer plantashun, dat dey
aint!"</p>

<p>"I am sorry," exclaimed Alice, "Is the cat quite
dead, Clarissa?" she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ded!" exclaimed Clarissa, "Sakes alive, ef yer
wus to see him yer wud fink dat he had been ded
all his life, dat yer wud. Has yer seen ole Jube?"
Clarissa continued.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is in the verandah," Alice replied.</p>

<p>"Ugh, Ugh! Glad ob dat. Fust fing Jube knows
he'll be hobblin er round on two legs ef he aint kilt
rite ded. De outdacious niggers! I wushes dey
wus run outen de lan."</p>

<p>Clarissa heard ole Jube bark, and looking out of
the kitchen window she saw the regulator shuffling
along in his slip-shod way with an old haversack
slung over his shoulder coming toward the front
verandah and observed with some perturbation.</p>

<p>"Miss Alice, dos yer know de truf. I'm pintedly
skeered ob dat speckled face white man. He
luks pine blank lak de kommisary ob de debbill
hissef. He aint arter no good on dis heer plantashun.
De fust fing enybody knows dere is ergwine

heerd in yer born days und nobody is agwine to
know de heds nur tails ov it. Look at dat ar wun
eye of his'n farely blazin lak a log-heep in de new
ground in de nite time," and Clarissa shuddered as
if the clutch of the "kommisary" was already upon
her.</p>

<p>"I have heard very strange stories about the
man" said Alice very solemnly, as if humoring the
ignorant old woman's apprehensions.</p>

<p>"Deed I has too," she replied, "Und if dey is
kerrect dat ar creetur haint no human no how,"
and Clarissa shuddered again even more violently;
"Hit natally makes my flesh creep lak santipedes,"
she exclaimed with fear. "Haint yu dun
und heerd how dat Koo-kluck mommucked up
brudder Joshaway, Miss Alice?" asked Clarissa.
"'Grate King!' How in de name of de hebbens dat
ole nigger ever retched dry lan eny mo wid all dat

Yander he cums now lak wun of dem ole cranksided
rare hosses, und I'm ergwine to fetch him
sum wittles rite fo yo eyes und den yu mout ax

<p>Joshua came up quite feebly, swathing his black
face with his red handkerchief and bowed humbly
to his former mistress.</p>

<p>"Now yu mout ax him, Miss Alice, arter he wours
up dat last moufful, and I lay hit will fetch de
creeps ober yu same as de mash ager."</p>

<p>The old negro seemed very grateful for the appetizing
food and in a heartfelt way thanked Alice
over and over again.</p>

<p>"Mout I sing er Mishinary hime, yung missis?"
he asked deferentially after he had eaten the last
morsel.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," replied Alice "I will be delighted
to hear you." And he sang very plaintively:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh Kanyun, sweet Kanyun when shall I see,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">When shall I git dere?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After he had concluded the song the young lady
asked sympathetically,</p>

<p>"I am told that you had quite an unhappy experience
at the creek a few nights ago Uncle Joshua?
Can you tell me about it?" Joshua groaned and
then answered with a display of feeling.</p>

<p>"Twas wusser dan er sperience, yung missis," as
he wiped the perspiration from his face, "twas een
wusser dan er yuthshake. Grate Jarryko! 'twas
een mo wusser dan de war."</p>

<p>"Ugh! Ugh! I tole yu so!" ejaculated Clarissa.</p>

<p>"But den," continued the old negro "Hit mouter

<p>"Grate King!" again exclaimed Clarissa; "How

<p>"How come I dare?" he replied. "Haint yu heerd

und dat's how I cum ter git kotched. Don't you
see missis?"</p>

<p>"Were you thrown into the water by some evil-designing
person, Uncle Joshua?" asked Alice with
a natural inquisitiveness.</p>

<p>Joshua groaned again; "Ugh-h-h-h!" he shuddered.</p>

<p>"Haint yu ergwine ter tell her de fust und last
ob it' Joshaway?" asked Clarissa, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Ef I hed one leetle moufful o' backer hit mout
tak de ambishun outen de tale, und den I mout
tell hit mo strater. Haint yu got narry crumb
missis, dat I mout fling ergin dis ole akefied snag?

Clarsy, ef yu ceeses yo mirashuns I'm ergwine ter
tell young missis how it all cum erbout frum de

<p>"Grate Jarryko! hit puts dese here fousan-leg
santypedes er rastlin under my westcote when I
draps back to dat ar casuality. Ugh-h-h-h!" he
shuddered again. "Now den, de tale goes disserway:
Dare cum erlong by my house in de shank of
de nite dis yer furriger. I calls him a furriger, but
I spishuns his rite name is Koo-kluck (I'm monstrous
skeert o' dat white man ennyhow)&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ugh-h-h-h!" shuddered Clarissa.</p>

<p>"Und he ups und sez, sez he, 'Joshaway, a woice

don't yu go ergin it, und den I'd no whey de munny

<p>"Oh, my hebbens!" again vociferated Clarissa.</p>

<p>"Und den I drug und drug und drug, und bimeby
I seed dat fish's two eyes. Ugh-h-h-h! Und den
I drapped back into de crick drownded to def.
Ugh-h-h-h!"</p>

<p>"Grate King," shouted Clarissa. "Wuz yu sho

<p>"Und den when I seed dat niggers too eyes of

<p>"Hung to de hook!" shrieked Clarissa interrogatively.</p>

<p>"To be sho, to be sho," replied Joshua with irritation;
"Duz yu spishun hit wur hung to de gallus?
Und ez I drapped missis, ez I drapped," he continued,
"I flung out dese too hands jess so missis,
und kotched holt of er nudder nigger drounded to
def by er sarcumstance dat haint neber been skivvered."</p>

<p>"Und den yer cum too ergin?" queried Clarissa
shaking with excitement.</p>

<p>"Naw chile," Joshua answered with gravity, "I
haint neber cum too no mo, dat I haint."</p>

<p>Jake had another delusion&mdash;that to do your work
without makin mistakes "yer must obsarve the consequences."</p>

<p>The old Colonel after he had finished his toilet
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
walked out into the verandah where he observed
Jake ambling toward the house and singing in a
monotone an old army doggerel of questionable
merit,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He who fights and runs away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will live to fight another day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he who is in battle slain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will never live to fight again."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The regulator walked up the stone steps into the
verandah with a leer in his countenance, satan-like
in its expression.</p>

<p>Old Jube slunk away with a sidelong glance at
the regulator as if he quite agreed with Clarissa
that "He wus not a humans, nohow," and coiled
himself up for the nap that had been needlessly
interrupted at the other end of the verandah.</p>

<p>"Now then sir, how do you propose to proceed
in this business?"</p>

<p>"I aint er going to proceed, the percession cums
at the latter eend. Now yer just hold yer breath,
mister, twill I fix my curlecules, and then you can
crack your whip and the percession will start to
the cemetery with music by the band."</p>

<p>The regulator filled a doubled barrel army canteen
full of gunpowder, and attached to it a fuse
that would burn half an hour before exploding.
After doing this he said to the Colonel,</p>

<p>"When yer sees the Yankee school-marm er coming
just call off the cussed niggers, twill I can
plant hit."</p>

<p>Colonel Seymour drew from his pocket a dozen
or more pennies as he caught sight of the school
marm riding down the road in her dogcart.</p>

<p>"Here, ye varmints!" he cried, and he threw one
piece of money at the time in the grass and the
negroes scrambled for it like a flock of geese over
scattered grains of corn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Simultaneously with the stroke of the old-fashioned
clock, came an explosion that recalled the
Crater with all its horrors to the regulator.</p>

<p>Clarissa ran out of the kitchen screaming,
"Murder! Fire! the Yankees is er comin. Great
king, mars Jon, de ruf and de chimney on de offis
is dun blowed clean erway. In de name of Gord,
what wus dat, ole marsa? Grate Jerusalam! which er
way did dat harrykin cum from? De road is fairly
er workin wid yung niggers widdout arms or
legs ergwine er bellering every which erway. Fo
Gord, de last time I seed dat er Yankee wumun
she wus er flying fru de medder lak er white herrun!"</p>

<p>After the smoke of battle had cleared the regulator
sneaked up to the Colonel with a broad grin
upon his face with the enquiry, "Did I do that er
job kerrect, mister?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<h3>THE OATH OF FEALTY.</h3>


<p>Since the death of Mrs. Seymour the negroes had
been busily plying their offensive vocation filling
to the very brim the vat of vicious fermentation.
The air at night was laden with ribaldry and
the sounds of guns. The old master's labors
were greatly multiplied too, since the negroes
were all the while in some exasperating way or
other celebrating the "Emancipation Proclamation,"
the dawn of freedom. Their presence
had become a serious menace, an ever recurring
cause of alarm. His resources, too, were almost
gone&mdash;the cattle had been slaughtered in the
range, the horses appropriated and returned when
convenient, and he dared not ask why this spoliation
of his property.</p>

<p>Ned would occasionally announce his arrival
upon the plantation by furious blasts from a great
cracked horn. He would be dressed from head to
foot in a blue uniform with bright brass buttons
and yellow cords upon the revers and
sleeves of his jacket, and a coarse slouched hat
with crossed swords in front, a huge yellow cord
with tassels around the crown, and it surmounted
by a peacock's feather. The old master
saw with disgust the foolish negro from the
verandah, marching up and down the carriage way
with his bright musket, going through the manual
of arms, "Sport Harms! Horder arms! Charge
bagonets!" Aleck and Ephraim and Henry were
dressed in the same fashion and going through the
same evolutions on another part of the plantation.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Now and then a discharge from the guns accompanied
by demoniacal yells would frighten poor
Alice almost to death. In the dead hours of night
these brutal negroes to terrify her and her father
would drill in the front yard of Ingleside with vulgar
and boisterous commands, and before breaking
ranks they would discharge their muskets with
horrifying screams&mdash;"Jess immitatin de brav sojer
boys at Fort Piller," they said. Ingleside was virtually
a camp of military instruction!</p>

<p>"Clarissa," Alice exclaimed, "we must go away
from here. We will be murdered if we do not get
away from these horrid negroes, I shall die with
fright if I remain here any longer. They can come
at any hour of the day or night and kill us. Father
is old and feeble and cannot protect me, and
you know, Clarissa, I cannot protect him. Please
go to him and tell him we must get away this very
day."</p>

<p>"Bress yo deer life, Miss Alice, ef yu seed how
dis po ole heart was a flip flappin, fust peert und
den slow, lak a yaller hammer beatin ergen er dedded
gum, fust on wun side und den on de tuther,
yu'd say ter yosef, 'po Clarsy!' Fo de Lawd, I'm
skeert mo wusser dan yu is, und ef dis heer flustrashun
is ergwine on much fudder de Lawd is gwine
ter rane down fire und brimstone on dese niggers
lak he dun on dem Mallyskites, und I specks er
grate big hunk is ergwine to hit Ned und Joshaway
too, rite slam twixt de eyeballs. Dem dare
niggers, jamby granddaddies of Methuserlum,
lookin lak hants in all dem fethers and brass buttons,
er heppin all ober de taters und de korn und
de cotton, und bress de Lawd, ef I must tell de
truf, dey is as perished up ez a mash hen er settin
on turkle eggs. Yu needn't larf lak dat, Miss
Alice; de Lawd is gwine ter show dese niggers
whos er totin de biggest strane, und when he sez de
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
wurd, dey's ergwine ter be dedder dan last yur's
gode wines, und&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Clarissa," interrupted Alice, "these
troublous times are but mercies in disguise?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my King!" ejaculated Clarissa in alarm,
"Murder's gwine ter rise, yu sez? Oh, my hebbens!
Is yu aiming fur dem kallamities tu cum immegiate,
missis?"</p>

<p>Alice laughed away the old negress' fears and
replied in explanation:</p>

<p>"I said they were mercies&mdash;mercies in disguise."</p>

<p>"Dat is mo better, Miss Alice," observed Clarissa,
slightly mollified. "Kase I knoed ef dat tuther
fing wuz ergwine ter hap'n, me und yu und ole marser
mout git kilt fo enybody but de niggers spishuned
er resurreckshun. Ole Clarsy's skin is powerful
black missis, und dis kinky hed is pided lak
dat ole wether's in de medder, but I'm ergwine ter
stan by yu und ole marser twell de eend, und when
Ole Marser up yander sez de word, I'm ergwine ter
ax yu ter berry Clarsy at ole missis' feet; und den
ef she heers de trumpet fust she'll call Clarsy, und
ef I heers it fust I'm ergwine ter call her, und den
me und her will jine hans und fly erway ter glory."</p>

<p>The pathos of this affectionate speech brought
tears to the eyes of her young mistress, and the
thought came out of her great sympathetic nature:</p>

<p>"Reconstruction so far has been a great smelting
furnace&mdash;it has separated the pure from the impure,
and with its refining heat has grappled with
hooks of steel the hearts of mistress and servant.
Would that I could dictate a fitting eulogium for
the faithful negroes; for those who are groping
still amid the shadows of an epoch that seems obedient
to no law but of caprice and change."</p>

<p>If I get to Heaven, Clarissa will be at the portal
with some such expression upon her tongue as this:
"Bress yer hart, missis, I've been waitin right here
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
fur yer ever since I heard yer wus er cummin. Come
wid me, young missis, und let me show yer dis beautifullest
city in de hole wurrel."</p>

<p>"Sixty days within which to prove your loyalty!"
"Sixty days" were coming upon tireless
pinions. Are the mills of the gods still grinding?
Is there yet water in the flume to run the heavy
wheel? Is there still grist to feed the stones?</p>

<p>"To prove your loyalty" ran the judgment. What
badinage to toss into the face of a man who had
braved death upon a hundred battle-fields and all
for "loyalty!" He had proved it by great scarifications
that would have appalled every carpet-bagger
in the South. Loyalty is the counterpart
of honor&mdash;the collaborator with duty, and the old
soldier for sixty five years had maintained and performed
his part in his particular sphere of life;
yea out of the crucible of hell he had rescued his
loyalty&mdash;his character as pure as the untrodden
snow.</p>

<p>Another sunrise shoots its gleams into the cribbed
heart of Old Ingleside, and Clarissa has not returned
to prepare breakfast; what can be the matter?
"Perhaps she is unwell. I am sure she cannot
be faithless," argued Alice with herself. "I
will go and see." As she entered the door of the
cabin she saw Ned rolling and tossing upon the
bed in wild delirium and she asked Clarissa what
was the matter with her husband.</p>

<p>"Don't know, Miss Alice," replied Clarissa, "epseps
he is tuck wurser wid wun ob dem bad spells
agin; dey is cummin und agwine ebery now and
den, und he gits rite foolish und komikell."</p>

<p>Alice drew her chair closely to the bedside and
felt of the old negro's head and it was very hot;
she felt his pulse and it was beating like a triphammer.
He was groaning, too, as if in great
pain, crying out in delirium occasionally "Charge
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
bagonet! Sport harms! hep! hep! hep!" as if
drilling and going through the manual of the soldier.
Alice saw that something must be done and
very quickly, and she said to Clarissa.</p>

<p>"I will run for the doctor."</p>

<p>"Lor, missis, yer a gwine a trapesing away over
yander fur de doctur by your lone lorn sef? I specks
hits er mile ur too ef its ary step."</p>

<p>Within an hour the physician was at the bedside
of the sick negro, diagnosing the case and prescribing
medicine.</p>

<p>"He is not in immediate danger," observed the
physician to Alice, "But he must be watched."</p>

<p>"I want to put him under your care and whatever
your charge may be I will pay it."</p>

<p>"Thank you, miss," replied the physician with a
smile. "I will see that he does not suffer for the
want of medical treatment. By the way, how is
your father's health now, Miss Alice?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I think I can see that he is failing, sir," the
girl replied sadly.</p>

<p>"I presume he, like every body else, is greatly annoyed
by the freedmen."</p>

<p>"Yes, a few of them have given us trouble," she
replied.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall see you again to-morrow. You
will find that the negro will rest very well after his
fever abates a little," and the doctor, shaking
Alice's hand cordially, bade her good morning.</p>

<p>"Now Clarissa," Alice said after the doctor had
gone, "You run over home and prepare breakfast
for father, and I will watch by Uncle Ned until
you get back.</p>

<p>"Miss Alice," exclaimed Clarissa "sposin dat
kommykle nigger gits outen bed what is yer
agwine to do den?"</p>

<p>The old negro's expression was so ludicrous that
Alice was obliged to laugh as she observed, "I will
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
take care of him; never mind. If he gets out of
the bed I will get him back again."</p>

<p>"Und him a plum stracted idjeot?" ejaculated
Clarissa as she passed out of the door.</p>

<p>Alice pursuing the directions of the physician,
brought from the spring near by a bucket of very
cold water and sat down again at the bedside and
very gently, soothingly, bathed the old negro's
face and brow. The fever was abating, still the
deft fingers dripping with the water pressed the
fevered face. Once Ned partially aroused exclaimed
deliriously,</p>

<p>"I'se a woting ebery time fur de boss, who's yer
a woting fur, Joshaway?"</p>

<p>After quite awhile Ned awoke, at first a little
abstracted and asked.</p>

<p>"Is dat yer, Clarsy, wid dem dar shiny eyes?"
and again dropped into a restful slumber.</p>

<p>This time there were no exacerbations, no delirium,
but he slept as tranquilly as a little child.
The fever had passed away. He awoke and saw
the dear child whom he had so brutally wronged
sitting like a guardian angel by the bed; her
white hands cool and refreshing still pressing his
forehead, and the old negro covered his wrinkled
face with his skinny hands and wept. Wept from
a sense of shame, remorse. He remembered that
when her need was sorest he had acted the brute&mdash;turned
his back upon this poor child who with a
full knowledge of his manifold acts of cruelty and
injustice was nursing him back to life.</p>

<p>"Is dat yer, Miss Alice?" he asked through his
blinding tears. "Gord bress yer dear sweet life,
young misses, I fort yer wus ur angel. I didn't
fink dat my young misses dat I left ober yander in
de grate house by her lone sef, to fend fur hersef
und de ole marsa, wud do dis urren ob mussy fur a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
po' outcast nigger lak ole Ned." And the old negro
began to cry afresh.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, Uncle Ned, the good Lord commands
us to visit the sick and I am trying to do my duty
toward Him and toward you. You are so much
better now; don't worry and cry over me. The Lord
is chastening us, but it is all for His glory, Uncle
Ned."</p>

<p>"When I woke fust time, missis, I didn't know
whar I wus," he continued, wiping his eyes, "und
den I drapped back to sleep agin und it peared lak
de butifullest sperits huvered all erround de bed,
and wun ob dem mo butifuller dan tother wuns
crep rite easy lak und put her hand on my forhed
und I heerd tother wuns call her 'Alice,' und I spishuned
it mouter been yer, I knowed it wus yer.
Does yer know why dis ole nigger cried jess now,
missis?" "Taint my fault dat I turned agin yer und
ole marsa&mdash;de Lord in Hebben knows it aint. Ef
I had minded Clarsy, yer und ole marsa wudn't
faulted me no how. I wudn't hurt a har on yer
hed for a wurrell ful of freedum&mdash;dat I wudn't.
De dratted niggers tole me how dat I mout be biggety
und play boss-lak, und den I wud git to be
leftenant und den I mout be cappen ob de miluntary
cump'ny, und wear grate big gold upperlips
lak de boss, und ef I wus agwine to die dis minit I
clares on my solemnkolly ofe dat dem dare biggity
white fokses in de town is de meanest passel ob
humans in de yurth. Dey is worsern jack-lanterns
'ticin' de culled fokses furder und furder into misery.
Missis, ef yer und ole marser will oberlook
dese here transgrashuns I'll nebber, nebber gin
yer no mo sorrer, dat I won't."</p>

<p>"Uncle Ned," replied Alice with her beautiful
eyes radiant through tears, "from the bottom of
my heart I forgive you if you have ever given offense
to my father or to me. I think I can see that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
great good is to come out of it all. Don't you
know how the children of Israel suffered in Egypt,
and in their journeyings through the desert land,
when the dry parched lands yielded no corn and
the Lord fed his people and led them safely into
Canaan?"</p>

<p>"Yes, marm, dat I duz, und He is ergwine ter
leed us outen dese lowgrounds, too, missis, und ef
He doan do dat I knows whut He is ergwine ter
do&mdash;He is ergwine ter dribe dese Filistin men outen
dis kentry wid a storm ob yaller jackets lak He
drib Farro outen de lan ob de Mallyskites."</p>

<p>Clarissa having performed her work in the great
house came into the cabin at this moment and was
greatly surprised to find Ned in an animated conversation
with her mistress: Ned observing as her
footfall arrested his attention:</p>

<p>"Dar now, Clarsy, yer is dun und gone und
fotched us down agin."</p>

<p>"Fotched yer whar, Ned," exclaimed Clarissa in
wonderment.</p>

<p>"Frum de perly gates, dat's whar," replied Ned.
"Me und Miss Alice has jes bin ergwine erbout all
ober de New Jerusalum, und yu fotched us rite
back to de yurth agen&mdash;dat's er sin ter yer, Clarsy."</p>

<p>"Fo de Lawd, is yer er plum stracted idjet? What
is yer er doin in de New Jerusulum? Is yer dun
und washed erway yer sins? I don't see no whings
in dis heer house&mdash;how did yer git up dar Ned."</p>

<p>Alice laughed immoderately, and even Ned
obliged himself to confess "dat he was in de sperret
in de New Jerusulum."</p>

<p>"Miss Alice," asked Ned quite earnestly, "has
yer got de good book wid yer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Ned, I have my mother's bible with me;
wherever I go it is my companion always. Shall I
read a passage to you?" answered Alice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ef yer plese, mum. I aims ter cut ernudder
notch in my ole walkin stick, und when I looks at
dat I'm ergwine ter drap rite down und pray."</p>

<p>Alice opened the little thumb-worn book at the
second chapter of John and began to read:</p>

<p>"My little children, these things write I unto you,
that ye sin not. And if any man sin we have an
advocate with the Father&mdash;Jesus Christ the Righteous."</p>

<p>"Don't you see, Uncle Ned," Alice said as she
looked up into the old negro's black face, "how
good the Lord is to us? He puts it into the mouth
of His apostle to call us little children, and he
tells us that the Saviour is pleading for us poor
sinners. 'Love not the world, neither the things
that are in the world. If any man love the world
the love of the Father is not in him.' When we
are in distress or trouble," continued Alice, "we
must turn away from the beggarly elements of the
world and cast our cares upon Him, for He careth
for us."</p>

<p>"Whot sort er elements did yer say, missis?"
asked Ned attentively.</p>

<p>"Beggarly elements," replied Alice. "There is
nothing that satisfieth in this life, uncle Ned; and
all the world can give us in comforts and riches
are as husks&mdash;we must look to Jesus and to Him
only for consolation&mdash;for salvation."</p>

<p>"Dat is de Gospel truf," exclaimed Clarissa, with
emotion.</p>

<p>"Miss Alice, will yer fault me fur axin yer wun
mo questun? Is dere eny defference in hebben
twixt er cullud pussun und a white pussun?"</p>

<p>"No indeed," replied Alice; "we are His children
if we are faithful&mdash;the work of His hands."</p>

<p>"Dat questiun, missis, has oversized me all dese
days, und I was afeered dat we was de gotes dat de
Lawd drib ober on tother side, erway frum de lams,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
kase, missis, when I gits dar I wants ter live rite
close ter ole marser's und young missis' 'great
house,' whar I kin see yer und tend yer boff."</p>

<p>"You will not need to do us that service, Uncle
Ned. You will have a mansion of your own; there
will be no great houses there. The good Lord will
know no difference between you and me, only as
you or I shall excel here in doing His holy will.
Don't you want to serve Him, old negro, so you
shall have a crown of rejoicing by and by?"</p>

<p>"Dat I does, young missis. My ole bones is mity
shackly, und it aint ergwine ter be long afore I goes
outen dis cabin fer de las time; und ef its His will
ter call me fust, I'm agwine ter pick out de butifulest
great house in de city, und stay rite dere lak
er watch-dorg twell yer und ole marser cums und
taks perseshun. When I gits outen dis bed, missis,
I'm gwine back home&mdash;gwine back to ole Mars Jon,
lak dat prodigle man dat woured up dem korn cobs
way out yander."</p>

<p>Alice, the true hearted Christian, could not withhold
her tears as the old negro so eloquently, yet
so ignorantly, revealed his love and loyalty. She
arose from her chair to bid him good bye:</p>

<p>"One word mo, missis, und den I'm dun. I wants
jes one little drap o' prayer, pleas'm."</p>

<p>Alice knelt reverently at the bed and tenderly
prayed that the old negro might be accepted as a
child of the King&mdash;a royal son of a Royal Father,
whose kingdom was above all thrones and principalities,
and from everlasting to everlasting.</p>

<p>"Und now, Clarsy," said old Ned, "yer stan rite
dere, und Miss Alice yer stan whar yer is, und hear
me swar dis ofe: 'I, Ned Semo, does swar und kiss
dis little bible ob ole missusses' who's dun und gon
to hebben, dat nebber mo' will I lif my mouf nur

<p>Let us believe that the recording angel in the
heavenly court has engrossed this oath in a never-fading

the sacred tome is read as witnessing the good
there is in the creature, the word "approve" shall

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<h3>THE BLACK DIPLOMAT.</h3>


<p>Alice was persevering in those little attentions
to the sick negro that were operating in a salutary
way upon his heart. What power, however rebellious
or unfriendly, could withstand the charm of
that fragrant life?&mdash;a life so redundant in acts of
charity and benevolence, that carried its dispensations
into the cabins of the poor freedmen to
whom the authorities under reconstruction made
so many promises&mdash;promises to the ear to be broken
to the hope.</p>

<p>The old negro's sympathies now and then for his
master and young mistress would die down into
ashes, and then again, when he looked toward
Ingleside and thought of its defenceless inmates,
his feelings would be grateful and kind.</p>

<p>In all the years that were gone, his old master
and mistress had been so kind to him, in sickness
and health; they had clothed and fed him; without
their assistance he would have been so helpless.
Indeed, Ned had never felt the rigors or oppression
of slavery in this household or upon this
plantation. Old master's government was patriarchal,
and emancipation had come so inopportunely;
somehow it never appealed to the affections,
or the love of the old negroes, but it came
upon them as other great crises have come&mdash;with
arguments and reinforcements that shattered every
principle of manhood and bestialized their natures.
It came with proclamations against the universally
denounced crime of slavery, and with an energetically
centralized power; and the old negroes, unable
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
to reason intelligently from premises so false
and enticing, forgot their loyalty to their friends
and looked to the carpet-bagger for a new revelation.</p>

<p>The lovely girl was always happy when ministering
to the sick, even in the huts of destitution
and squalor. She was happy when she pressed
Uncle Ned's wrinkled brow and felt that the consuming
fever had been driven out of his system by
medication and faithful nursing.</p>

<p>When her own heart was burdened by sorrow,
she sang out of its fullness and pathos to the negro,
and the tears glided out of his eyes and ran
down into the deep-cut furrows of his black face.</p>

<p>The old negro discovered in the experience of
the few eventful years that there was nothing hopeful
or helpful in the pledges or proclamations of
the reconstructionists. The very old negroes were
not counted in the aggregation of their numerical
power, or in the sum total of the freedmen. "Old
Glory" never welcomed them with a dip of its proud
crest as they passed in and out of the town in tatters
and rags. It never bade them with its caress
to pause within its grateful shadow in the dog days
when they were over wearied with marching and
counter-marching.</p>

<p>The great Commissariat persistently withheld its
bounty when there was no election&mdash;no votes to be
polled for Laflin and his pampered minions. These
dilapidated creatures were post-prandial guests in
the banqueting halls of the bosses; hounds rather to
gnaw the bones that were flung as offal upon the
refuse heaps. They were not the artisans who were
toiling upon the superstructure of the new south;
not wanted in cabals, intrigues, conventions; not
the journeymen who where revamping the political
edifice; not mechanics who were furbishing the
weapons of plunder; not trained to the harness as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
beasts of burden in dragging the car of reconstruction
with its whetted knives over the prostrated
country. Hence it was that gaunt poverty with its
steel tined fork was constantly prodding the old
negroes who had turned their backs upon their
masters and whose new masters were dull of hearing,
hence it was that so many who had hungered
for the flesh pots were going back to the leaks and
garlic; hence it was that hunger had given such
acuteness to old Ned's sense of smell, that Alice
was greeted with an exclamation brimming over
with gratitude.</p>

<p>"I'm so skeert, young missis, dat I haint ergwine
to git outen dis house in a hole munt."</p>

<p>The exclamation provoked a smile from the sweet
girl who came laden with good things for Ned and
she replied apologetically,</p>

<p>"I am sorry, uncle Ned, that I couldn't know
just what you wanted."</p>

<p>The sick negro shook his head, for his mouth was
too full for verbal explanations, and then bowed
his thanks, observing after a moment.</p>

<p>"Clarsy, when I heerd yung missis at de do I
node it was Santy Clors, sho nuff."</p>

<p>"Bress you hart, missis, enny nigger dat wudn't
fite twell def fur yu und ole marser had ort to be
hung by de nek twell hes ded."</p>

<p>Ned would have extemporized upon the subject
perhaps at greater length; but for the interruption
of a dilapidated negro, dressed in a dingy threadbare
blue uniform; whose white head was covered
by a decayed beaver, from which a dirty red
handkerchief hung over his left eye.</p>

<p>The new comer was Joshua; perhaps the first and
most patriotic recruit in the army of the freedmen;
among the first to cut asunder the ligature of
slavery.</p>

<p>As the huge Commissariat advertised the fatness
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
of reconstruction, so Joshua advertised the leanness
thereof.</p>

<p>The black diplomat in a tentative way was
preparing the colored people for an event of momentous
consequence. His mission to Ned's cabin
was for this purpose.</p>

<p>"Mornin to yu boff," came the crusty greeting.</p>

<p>"Is dat yu, brudder Joshaway?" Clarissa enquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, dis is me."</p>

<p>"Cum in, den," said Clarissa, and Joshua, reeling
from old age tottered in and took a seat with a
groan.</p>

<p>"Is dat you, Miss Alice?" he asked looking up
and shading his eyes with a palsied hand and seeing
the young lady in the cabin.</p>

<p>"Scuse me, marm, I haint seed yu afore."</p>

<p>"Good morning, Uncle Joshua, I am very glad
to see you. You are a stranger to us and the old
home. I should think you would come to see us
now and then, to know how we are getting on.
Have you entirely forgotten your old friends?"</p>

<p>The old negro dropped his head embarrassingly
as he replied with hesitation. "Not eggzackly,
mum, but fokeses has dun und got so kurous now
a days dar haint no telling how menny scrapes yu
is ergwine to git kotched in; I'm moest afeered to
git outen Hanner's wision, deed I is, mum."</p>

<p>"You are not a soldier I hope, uncle Joshua? Do
you belong to the army," asked Alice as she observed
the blue uniform that he wore.</p>

<p>"No mum, not pintedly," the negro furtively
answered. "Dat is I don't tote no muskeet&mdash;und
I got my deesharge from de leftenant&mdash;und I haint
got no offis in pertickler, but de cappen lowed dat
he mout pint me corpurul of de gyard at de kumissurry
ef I cud hole out."</p>

<p>"Ef I cud hole out" sneeringly repeated Clarissa.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
"Ugh! Nigh unto er hunded year ole er holin
out; mouter say ef yu cud hole in; jess es ragged es
er sedge hen."</p>

<p>Alice was very much amused at the coarse wit of
Clarissa, but it was important that she should return
home and perhaps, too, her presence might embarrass
the interview between the freed slaves, and
taking uncle Joshua's hand in her own she bade
him good bye with the observation.</p>

<p>"Remember, old man, that father and I are still
your friends; and when you are in trouble or distress
come to us. May God bless you, uncle
Joshua."</p>

<p>"Good by, missis!" exclaimed Joshua, as he
wiped his eyes with his coat sleeve, "May de
Lord do de same to yu missis."</p>

<p>After the young lady had retired, Joshua, with
some trepidation, observed:</p>

<p>"Brudder Johnsing, Hanner sont me ober heer
to ax yu und sister to de weddin Saddy nite und to
tell sister Johnsing how she mout bake er cake
wid ice on de tip eend of hit, ur she moutent
ef she didn't want to."</p>

<p>"Who dat want er cake?" exclaimed Clarissa.</p>

<p>"Yu heerd whot I sed, didn't yu?" Joshua petulantly
replied.</p>

<p>"Who dat ergwine to git married Joshua?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Efrum, dats who," replied Joshua.</p>

<p>"My King! dat biggerty nigger ergwine to git
married sho nuff?"</p>

<p>"Deed he is, und he is ergwine to marry way up
yander outen site too&mdash;ergwine to git er portly
white gal wid de moest dimuns und watch chains
und bunnets kivered wid hostrich fedders. When
yu sees dat gal yu'll see er hole steer kaart full of
dimuns er shinin ebery which er way; und yu has
to keep yo eyes shot rite tite, don't yu ergwine to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
git struck plum bline, same as de possle Peter
dun when dat white man was ergwine up to Jarriko;
dat yu will! Is you und sister Jonsin ergwine
to de weddin; und is yu ergwine to bake de
cake? Tell me dat fust."</p>

<p>Clarissa deliberately raised herself out of the
rickety chair in which she was sitting, with a
grunt, and walked over to Joshua, and lifting the
old beaver from his head, remarked in a provoking
way:</p>

<p>"I spishuned dat de boss had dun und crapped
yo years wid swaller forks."</p>

<p>"How much yu dun und got from ole Laffin fur
bein his nigger; yu und Efrum; tell me dat?"</p>

<p>"Swaller forks!" indignantly replied Joshua.
"Sich humans as yu is dun woured up de creeters
dat toted de swaller-forks fo de belliun fell. Swaller-forks!"
he again repeated in disgust; and turned in
his seat to look savagely at Clarissa and held his
peace.</p>

<p>"You need nt shine dem ole holler eyes at me,
Joshaway; yuse ergwine erbout er hipperty hop
from wun house to ernudder wid yo weddin inwites
und I lay a fo pence yu haint got narry tater

When yu sees er biggerty nigger er jinin hissef to

<p>"Yu and Efrum needn't spishun kase de Soufland

tip eend of yo ole hed is ergwine to be layin in
wun jam of de fence und yo old karkuss in er nudder.
Ergwine to de weddin! Grate Jerusalem!"</p>

<p>Joshua for a moment was completely disarmed
by the rapid volleys from Clarissa's battery, but
he was not without resources, even in this terrific
encounter. He fixed his savage glance upon the
old negress, as he asked with due gravity.</p>

<p>"Is yu ergwine to fight for the secesh ef de war
do take a fresh rise?"</p>

<p>"Yu heerd what I sed, Joshaway," replied Clarissa
with a significant gesture. "Ef yu don't want
Mars Jon's sord er gashing yu into leetle hunks of
horg meat yu got to walk mity perpundikkler.</p>

<p>"Bress God!" exclaimed Joshua as he wiped his
face with his dirty handkerchief, "How kin a humans
walk perpundikkler wid free crooks in de
back und de rumatiz in boff shanks?"</p>

<p>"Dat ole sord is ergwine to tak dem dere crooks
outen yore back same as a toof doctor jerkin out
dat ole snag of yourn," answered Clarissa.</p>

<p>"To be sho yu haint ergwine agin yo own kuller?"
suggested Joshua.</p>

<p>"Is yu fur de Nuniun ur de Secesh, ef de belliun
haint squelched ur nuffin?"</p>

<p>There was a directness about the question that
momentarily unnerved Clarissa but she saw that
she was tacitly reinforced by Ned and she replied
with the same exhibition of temper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Me und Ned is boff ergwine to fight for ole
marser, ef de war haint swaged und de time we gits
froo wid yu, yu's ergwine to immytate dat ole gyarment,
er layin dere in dat pail of poke juice."</p>

<p>"Grate Jarryko!" exclaimed Joshua with vehemence,
"dat ar nigger dun und fotched on ernudder
belliun widout ary shutin ion ur muskeet udder.
Don't do hit, chile," he continued patronizingly,
"kase ef yu uprares ernudder insurreckshun

po souf, de dekins in de church is ergwine to fling
yer into outer darkness. Yu er sot back er Sundys

lak de slidin elder, er singin 'Kanyun, sweet Kanyun,'
und bress Gawd yu is batin de lams ob de
flock wid leetle mouffuls o' hell farr."</p>

<p>"Ergwine tu de weddin! My Lord!" This was
the derisive answer that Clarissa made to this fanfaronade
of old Joshua.</p>

<p>Ned laid upon the bed laughing to himself with
his eyes fixed upon the crude masonry of a dirt-dauber
that was preparing to go into winter quarters
just above his head.</p>

<p>"Is yu dun wid speechifyin, sister Johnsin?"
asked uncle Joshua as he again wiped his moist
face with his handkerchief. "Ef yu is, I has jes got
wun reckymendashun fur sich ez yu. Pend upon
it, sister, ef yu wus Hanner und Hanner wus yu, I
wud play hail-kerlumby-happy-lan on yo ole bones
wid er palin fo brekfus und arter supper too, all
de time. Ole Satan hes dun und stobbed boff yo
yeares wid pitch-forks, und de Lawd nose he is
wusser dan de boss, und de pitch-forks is wusser
dan de swaller-forks. Ef dat white gal wants to
jine hersef to dat cullud gemman, who's ergwine to
hender? Tell me dat? I haint ergwine to pester
mysef wid no sich low down trash es yu is, und ef
yu goes to de weddin dare haint ergwine to be no

weddin gyarment fur yu, und when yu nocks at
de do, brudder Effrum is ergwine to fling yu out
into tarnel darkness whar de whang doodlum hoops
und hollers fur hits onliest chile."</p>

<p>"My King," exclaimed Clarissa "whot is dat ole
nigger er spashiatin erbout Ned?"</p>

<p>Ned could not restrain himself, but burst out into
a great guffaw. Joshua angered above measure
gathered himself together and walked out of the
cabin with the observation:</p>

<p>"I wants to see wun mo whupping post in de lan
fo I dies, und I wants hits uprared at dis do, und I
wants to fling de whoop fur de high shuruff."</p>

<p>Upon the exit of Joshua Ned began seriously to
think of the flagrant acts of injustice which had
more or less warped his nature; and all in his
heedless pursuit of freedom and sovereignty. He
saw within his cabin a perpetual menace to the
peace of old master and young mistress. Upon
every visit that Alice made to his lowly home he
saw that a grief too deep to be sounded, bayonetted
afresh her poor heart. The armed soldier who slew
her brother and sweetheart wore a blue jacket like
the one that hung in the rack above his bed; how
could he be true to his oath with these menaces
flaunting in the face of his young mistress? So with a
huge frown upon his face he said to his wife,
"Clarsy, dem ole blu gyarments und dat ole muskett
is jess whot plade de devul twixt me und ole
marser. Mouter node dey wud set ole marser er
fire; he er fitin dem yankys fur fo year in de war

to de boss leftenent, und tell him dat corpul Jonsin
has sined his persish in de milintery cumpny,
und dat he aint ergwine to war no mo."</p>

<p>"Dats whot you orter dun und dun fo yu jined,"
answered Clarissa deprecatingly; "jess gon und
fotched all dis trubble on de lan fur nuffin. Mouter
node ole marser was ergwine to raise er harrykane
when he seed de cussed niggers wid dere muskeets
er marchin up und down de plantashun lak er passel

<p>"Yander cums Ellik now lak a lunytik wid fedders
nuff on de tip eend of his hat to stuff a fedder
bed, wid his neck as stiff es er poker und his eyes
same es de sun in de clipse er sot in de sky."</p>

<p>"Halt! Serlute!" came a self addressed command
from the negro sergeant.</p>

<p>"Aha! missus Jonsin, how is yo ladyship dis
a. m.?" he asked in the stern voice of an officer.</p>

<p>"I haint got no ladyship; dats whot I haint got,
nur I haint ergwine to say amen to no sich dooins
nudder," replied Clarissa poutingly.</p>

<p>"Hi!" ejaculated the black sergeant; "why, missus
Jonsin," he continued "De las time I dun yu
de onner to wisit yu, yu was spashiatin erbout de
fousend doller peanny corpul Jonsin was agwine
to purchis fur yu, und how yu was ergwine to play

<p>"Ugh!" grunted Clarissa scornfully, "I plays de

clean wo' out on de wash bode, er slavin fur er no
count miluntary nigger jes lak yu."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nigger!" exclaimed the sergeant derisively,
"Dere is no niggers in dis 'lan ob de free und de
home ob de brave.' We is sufferens und kings, und
our wifes und dorters is queens; und yu holes de
specter in yo hans ef yu node it."</p>

<p>Clarissa, greatly irritated at the saucy negro,
placed her arms akimbo, and fixing her gaze upon
him, exclaimed with wrath,</p>

<p>"Yu go erway frum here, Ellik. I natally spises
yu enny how, yu hateful creetur. I haint er puttin
my mouf on yu, nigger, but fo' dis bressed year
runs out, yu is ergwine ter be er spexter, und de

fokeses in de town fools yu to def yit."</p>

<p>"Yu sprises me, missus Jonsin," responded
the negro with assumed dignity. "I spishioned yu
wus a patrot."</p>

<p>"No I haint, nudder, und I haint ergine tu be
no patrot; but I kin tell yu whot yu is ergwine ter
be fo' dis year runs out&mdash;yu is ergwine ter be er

back to stay. Dat is de moest senserbulest fing
you can doo; dats whot me und Ned dun und dun
und now ole mars Jon is es happy es a cockerroche
in er borrul of flour."</p>

<p>The sergeant waltzed up to Clarissa, and taking
her with some violence by the arm sang in a harsh
unmusical voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh: say kin yu see by the dorhns early lite?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>when a heavy back banded blow sent the sergeant
bowling, as Clarissa shouted in her anger.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yaas, I sees de dorn und yu sees de stors."</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed "I perseeves yu is not er patrot," and he commanded
"Attenshun! eyes to de front! forrard march!" and marched away as he
whistled</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"De jay bird died wid de hooping coff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Und de sparrer died wid de kollery."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Clarissa made one observation as the negro marched off, "Yu will be ded,
sted of de sparrer und de jay bird."</p>

<p>What had become of the warning paragraph in the reconstruction calendar?
The three blood red stars that punctuated the enigmatical judgment,
"sixty days within which to prove your loyalty." Powers that be, at
whose shrine shall the persecuted man make the act of apotheosis? Shall
it be at the altar of Laflin, the freedman's deity? Shall it be in the
presence of the cringing minions who will mock at his calamity and laugh
when his fear cometh?</p>

<p>An arctic night has dropped down upon the south;
and in our dense blindness we know not in what
direction lies the Serbonian bog. We once erected
upon this soil a mighty temple which wisdom and
virtue consecrated to patriotism. We laid the edifice
upon foundations of concession and compromise;
and we were vain enough to believe that it
would stand forever; but not so. So the dykes of
Holland; the mountains of Switzerland, and the
surrounding Sea of Venice were proclaimed as everlasting
pledges for the preservation of patriotism,
but intestine struggles engendered those revolutionary
factions which invited the attack of a despotism
and secured its victory. So reasoned with himself
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
this veteran of the civil war, and the father
of a loyal-hearted daughter, this slave of a power
whose minions were drunken with its excess.</p>

<h3>UNDER THE HAMMER.</h3>


<p>As Colonel Seymour was passing a group of negroes
in the court-yard this irritating remark
from one of them arrested his attention. "Dat
dar secesh's home is agwine to be sold at auction
ter day under a margige, und de boss is ergwine
ter buy hit;" and very soon thereafter a half-grown
negro boy ringing a huge bell, and bearing
aloft a placard as imperiously as a Roman lictor
bore the axe and fasces, halted before him, and displayed
offensively the following advertisement.
"By virtue of a certain deed of mortgage executed
by John W. Seymour and wife Alice to James W.
Bowden, and duly recorded in the proper office of
the &mdash;&mdash; county, and value duly assigned to me,
I shall sell for cash on Saturday, the 6th day of
November, 186&mdash; the lands and premises described
in said mortgage deed, and known and designated
as Ingleside, containing twenty-five hundred
acres," Abram Laflin, assignee. Thus ran the
publication that may possibly furnish a key to the
mystic meaning of the three blood-red stars under
the written order. "Sixty days in which to prove
your loyalty." To-day, and the patrimonial estate
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
of Ingleside with all but its cherished memories,
will pass by right of purchase into the hands of
the carpet baggers and negroes; to-day, and the axe
of the barbarian will be laid at the roots of the
ancestral oaks; to-day, and the grained corridors
will echo to ribaldry and wassail; to-day, and the
war scathed veteran and his beautiful daughter,
like the pariahs of Hindoostan, shelterless vagrants,
will beg their bread and home. "If an uninterpretable
destiny; if an inscrutable providence
so orders and decrees, that I shall surrender this
home, yet as token of the love I bear this wretched
country, I will abide by her; I will cherish her as
my wife, my mother, my child; I will defend her
with my sword, my speech, my life, and I
will be to my oppressed countrymen, their
friend, their champion and their brother. I abhor
these natural sons of Belial who are whetting
the knife that will drink their blood;" so exclaimed
the old soldier without a blemish upon his
name. So thought the fire-tried christian who was
appealing to the ultimate tribunal for right; so
thought the man who was harrassed by every resource
of vengeance, as he turned his rigid face
from the jeering crowd, the assassins of his peace.</p>

<p>The old man with fading memory tried in vain
to recollect the transactions he had had with
James W. Bowden, to whom he once owed twenty-five
thousand dollars, and to whom he had conveyed
in trusts the valuable estate of Ingleside.
He asked appealingly of his daughter "Have you
no knowledge of these affairs that will aid me in
this extremity."</p>

<p>"My dear father," she answered reflectively, "I
am sure the debt has been paid. Indeed I heard you
say that you paid it in gold."</p>

<p>"But where are my papers?" he asked; "Scattered
to the winds by the school mistress and her negro
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
pupils. Shall I ever be able to exhibit any proof
of its payment? Can you not assist me? Perhaps
we may find somewhere the cancelled note."</p>

<p>Bowden was dead and a profligate son alone survived.</p>

<p>There were a hundred negroes who thronged the
negro auctioneer.</p>

<p>"What is I bid fur dis plantashun?" "Fifteen
thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Hold!" interrupted Colonel Seymour now advancing.
"I forbid the sale of this land or any part of
it, the debt is paid."</p>

<p>"Ha, Ha. Ha," jeered the negroes, "dat dar secesh's
mind is a puryfied wanderin," shouted a
chorus of voices. "Cry de bid Mr. auctioneer,"
shouted the negro Wiggins. "Ef dat ar white man
mak eny mo sturbance, we's agwine ter slap him
in de jail forthwid. I warrantees de title fer de
boss." "Twenty thousand&mdash;&mdash;twenty-five thousand&mdash;&mdash;once,
twice, free, times dun und gone to
Mr. Laflin."</p>

<p>The whole affair seemed an illusion, an unnatural
evaporation of land and houses&mdash;the Ingleside plantation
dissipated into thin vapor like the genii of
the sealed casket in the Arabian Nights.</p>

<p>"Great God," exclaimed the broken hearted old
man, "and Laflin the wretch! Laflin the monster
standing there in dumb show, and nodding his
head in savage and pantomimic gravity when the
hammer fell."</p>

<p>The old Colonel and his daughter rode back to
their home perhaps for the last time. One of
the blood-red stars had been blotted out of the tyrants'
calendar. Two more like the painted dolphins
in the circus at Antioch remained to be taken
down, one by one. The search for the missing
document was renewed when they reached home,
but unavailingly. Alice however discovered in an
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
old ash barrel in a neatly folded package, two papers
signed by Abram Laflin to her father; one a
note for five thousand dollars, the other a mortgage
securing the payment of the note. No trace
however, of the twenty-five thousand dollar mortgage.
Alice carried the Laflin note to her father
whose mind for a moment appeared a complete
blank; he then remembered the transaction circumstantially.</p>

<p>"Yes, Yes," he exclaimed reminiscently; "the
note was executed to me as a fee, when he was indicted
and acquitted for murder in 1866. Now he
may let slip the dogs of war, and 'damned be he
who first cries hold! Enough!'"</p>

<p>It was painful to observe that Mr. Seymour had
become so injuriously affected by the exciting
events transpiring from day to day, that his mind
upon matters of business was almost inert. Certainly
his memory was fast failing; a giving away
of the mental poise; and in consequence thereof,
poor Alice was picking up here and there great
bits of trouble, with as much freedom as the washwoman
gathers sticks for her fire. "Tomorrow she
exclaimed will be the Sabbath. Blessed day will
it bring surcease from sorrow, a moment's respite
from the maelstrom of trouble?" she asked, "I can
only hope. I feel sometimes like crying aloud,
'What shadows we are, and what shadows we pursue'!"</p>

<p>When the morning broke tranquilly upon the
old home, the little birds were caroling in the
trees, and the poor girl felt that her care worn
spirit should rest this holy Sabbath day. After
the morning meal, her father perturbed and dejected
walked along the river's bank, and she retired to
the parlor where she sang and played. In the evening
old Ned came to express again his sense of
gratitude to his young mistress and his old master,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
and observed among other things, remorsefully,
how foolish he had been to take up with the vagaries
of the negroes, who were fomenting so much
trouble. "And mars John," he continued, "I seed
where I was agwine rong, und I knowed yu wud
fetch me outen de miry clay. Times is er gitten
so mistrustful dat I cum ter ax yu und yung missis
mouten me und Clarissa stay wid yu in de grate
house? Whar we kin run on urrans fo yu nite und
day."</p>

<p>Old Ned like the hunted rabbit had been smoked
out of his hollow. Reconstruction with its insipid
pageants had come: It had emptied its cornucopia
in the old commissariat; not a dust of flour, nor a
fluid dram of molasses, nor a pound of bacon had
it put into the jug or sack of the aged and the poor;
and the stars and stripes waved as proudly from
its mast head as if there were no vacant stomachs,
no hungry freedmen in all the South. Colonel
Seymour was inexpressibly glad to see the change
that had come over the spirit of the old slave. He
had been employed in many situations and he was
faithful in all. He had been his carriage driver;
he had packed old missis trunks when she went to
the seaside or the springs in the happy old days;
and Ned remembered how contented he was, when
an imaginary line separated peace from discord,
plenty from squalor. He had seen old missis put
away in the ground, and with him were feelings
that would not be stifled that were now recasting
his nature, however sensual and hardened it had
become by contact with vicious companions. When
the clouds of war lowered angrily Ned's faith in
old missis grew stronger and stronger, and like a
watch dog always on duty, so Ned was always at
his post; to obey every command, to anticipate
every wish. It was Ned who held ajar the old plantation
gate, that day the young cavalier rode into
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
the deepening shadows on his way to Manassas,
and with hat in hand bade him good-bye with the
entreaty, "Be shore und cum back nex Saddy to
yo po mammy. I'll be rite heer to open de gate."
It was Ned who reverently placed the spray of
the little immortelle upon the grave of Mars
Harry when the procession had turned their
faces homeward. It was Ned who carried "old
Missis" in his arms back to the carriage when
she swooned at the grave, and now he had come
back like the prodigal confessing his sins.</p>

<p>"If Gord spares me ter outlive ole marser, I'm
agwine ter put him erway lak ole missis and yung
mars Harry, und strow his grave wid hiasents und
lillys ob de valley. I haint agwine ter put no mo
pendence in de carpet baggers, dey will gouge de
eyeballs outen yo hed, und I'm agwine ter twist
my eyes clean erround de tother side when I passes
de ole kommissery. 'Ole glory' is jess flirting
up its skerts, und larfing when poor ole niggers is
agwine erlong de rode, jess es scornful es er flop-eared
mule when he pokes yu under de jaw wid
his hind foot, widout ary warnin. I wishes dat de
bosum of struction wud slam de ole kommissery
clean clar to de yurth, dat I does."</p>

<p>"You seem to be very thoroughly disgusted
with the situation Ned?" observed the Colonel.</p>

<p>"I is mars John, deed I is. Ef a pusson fools yu
won time, or maybe two times, er yu mout say free
time, you mout try him agin, but ef he fools yu
all de time ole Marser, what is yu agwine to do
den, mout as well be flinging de hook in de crick
for Joshaway's munny, as agwine to dat ole kommissery
wid yo happysack speckin arry moufful ob
wittles."</p>

<p>"Is that the experience of all the colored people?"
the Colonel inquired.</p>

<p>"No sar, no sar," Ned replied with feeling.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
"Dem dat carries woters to de conwenshun, und
drinks de bosses sperits dey gits a leetle now und
den, but tother wuns sucks de fingers in misury all
de time, specktin, un gittin disappinted."</p>

<p>"By the way tell me something about Ephraim,
how is he getting on," asked the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Why bress your soul mars John he is clean
outen site; er totin great big yaller upper lips on
his sholders, und er sword dat runs on a wheel on
de groun, und fedders on his hat same as a pee-fowell.
He is dun und growd outen my membrance.
Dey got norated eroun dat he is agwine ter marry
a white gal in de town, und Joshaway und Hannah
has dun and got er inwite to de weddin."</p>

<p>"And Aleck, what is he doing?" asked the
Colonel.</p>

<p>"Ugh, Ugh," exclaimed Ned, "now yu obersizes
my kalkilashuns, mars John. He's wusser den
Efrum, er uprarin fine housen all ober dis plantashun."</p>

<p>"The savage?" muttered the enraged man. "All
Laflin's doings I suppose. Sixty days within
which to prove your loyalty," he muttered. "The
black flag of the buccaneers of reconstruction
marked not with death's heads but by red stars!"
A score of carpenters were plying their vocation
on the plantation. A confusion of sounds, such
as sawing and hammering, drowned the melody of
the singing birds, and Aleck like the boldest of
pirates, was caracoling here and there giving orders;
and fashionably dressed negro women strolled
offensively and imperiously over the grounds.</p>

<p>"Mars Jon," exclaimed Ned, "I dun and tole yu
so; now yu sees fo yosef."</p>

<p>Before the deed of purchase was recorded, the
devilish freedmen were enforcing their claim to the
plantation by visible, notorious and violent occupation.
The colonel and Alice were sitting in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the verandah one beautiful starlit night; there was
scarcely the rustle of a leaf and the full-orbed
moon was shining with a radiant splendour. Of
course there was but one event to think about.
Was it not a grief that lay like a dead bulk upon
the heart, all the day and all the night; and peopled
their dreams with negroes and ogres too?</p>

<p>"Thank God," exclaimed Alice "mother is out
of it all. They were but heaping the fagots
around the furnace when she so wearied went home
to her eternal rest. Now the fires are all consuming."</p>

<p>"My daughter," said Colonel Seymour dejectedly
after awhile, "I will go to my grave with the
knowledge that the Bowden debt has been paid;
and not one cent do I owe upon it. It is possible
I may err, but as God is my judge, this great
loss has come upon me, through the devilish machinations
of Laflin, in the employment of the
schoolmistress, to occupy the office in which he
knew my valuable papers were deposited. An ingeniously
devised plot doubtlessly, but one distressingly
successful."</p>

<p>"Mars Jon," interrupted Clarissa quite seriously,
"Haint yu neber foun dem papers yit, yu was er
sarchin fur?"</p>

<p>"No indeed, and I do not believe I shall ever
find them."</p>

<p>"Grate King! Ole marser I specks dem dere
pizen niggers shoolickin eround de offis dun und
stroyed em outen puryfied cussedness."</p>

<p>"Quite likely," rejoined the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Lemme studdy er minit," said Clarissa.
"Pears lak Ned gin me sum papers to stow erway
in my ole blue chiss. Wud yu kno hit ef you
wast to see hit mars Jon? Don't speck it is wurf
nuffin do. Ned he gin hit to me way back yander,
I dismember how long ergo, und he tole me to put
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
it in de blu chiss, twell he ax for hit. Don't speck
hit is ergwine to do mars Jon no good do, but hit
haint ergwine to pizen noboddy ef hit don't doo no
good. I'm ergwine to fetch it rite now."</p>

<p>The old gentleman paid but little attention to the
negro until he saw her returning with uplifted
hand like a stalking spectre.</p>

<p>"Now mars Jon," she cried, out of breath, "yu
read dat paper, und cide fo yoself."</p>

<p>As soon as the old man took the paper in his
hand, he forgot his gouty joints, and his white
hairs; he forgot who he was or where he was and
danced a succession of Scottish reels with old Clarissa,
as an unwilling partner.</p>

<p>"Why father!" cried Alice in great fright, "Clarissa!
Clarissa! What is the matter with my dear
father?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh! Oh! The mortgage and the note! The
mortgage and the note!" wildly screamed her
father. "Thank God! Thank God!"</p>

<p>Clarissa, rubbing her head with both hands
where it had struck a pillar in the wild whirl of
the dance, emotionally exclaimed, "Bress de Lord;
mars Jon has yu dun und gon plum crazy? I neber
seed sich shines fo in all my born days; jambye
busted dis ole hed wide open ergin dat postess."</p>

<p>"Clarissa," excitedly exclaimed the Colonel,
"you shall have forty acres and a mule too."</p>

<p>"Grate Jurusulum! Mars Jon, whot I want wid
dat lan? Und I dun got wun mule, und de Lord
knose he tarrifies de life outen me."</p>

<p>"Alice," remarked her father, still excited, "I
know all about the matter now. Old Mr. Bowden
was very ill when I paid the debt, but feebly raised
himself in bed and marked upon the face of the
note, 'Paid in full.' Here it is," said the Colonel,
"and he surrendered the note and mortgage in the
presence of his worthless son, and promised that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
he would cancel the record; but the poor fellow
died. His son witnessed the settlement. I had no
doubt that this villainous son, knowing that his
father had died before cancelling the mortgage,
and believing that in the terrible condition of the
country I could not prove the payment of the debt,
did unlawfully, maliciously and feloniously conspire,
combine and confederate with the wretch
Laflin to defraud me of my property. Thank God
the beasts have been hounded to their lair. I remember
that upon coming out of the town my
hands were filled with letters and papers, and in
getting into my carriage this particular package
dropped into the road and I ordered Ned to pick
it up, and I doubt not that while I was busy reading
Ned did not care to interrupt me, and put it
into his pocket, and thinking it of no value, forgot
to give it to me. I feel now like falling down upon
my knees and thanking the great God of heaven
and earth for this, His especial providence and mercy."</p>

<p>It is said that in one of the beautiful isles in
the southern Pacific&mdash;the land of the mango and
pineapple, where the air is perpetually perfumed
by the aroma of flowers; where the birds of every
plume and every voice, like animated pictures in
gold and emerald and carmine, flit in and out of
whispering branches; where pellucid waters ripple
along, their voices keyed to song and laughter&mdash;that
the people are bestial and barbaric. They distil
from a gum that exudes from one of their umbrella-top
trees an intoxicant that bestializes the
man, woman and child who drinks it, and he or
she will run a-muck, ferocious in temper, devilish
in spirit, and betraying a morbid desire to destroy
whoever or whatever they may encounter. Here
in these full grown years of nineteenth-century
civilization, amid Christian churches and ministers;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
amid ten thousand object lessons suggesting
the vanity of human pursuits originating in wrong;
the eternity of God's punishments; the certainty
and swiftness of His retributions&mdash;the black, defiled,
distorted genius of reconstruction was running
a-muck, drinking from a brazen chalice the
sweetened liquor.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<h3>A HOUSE WARMING.</h3>


<p>A skilled artisan in the employment of the local
authorities had been for many days surveying and
diagramming, until a certain area of the old plantation
remote from the mansion was arranged in geometrical
figures, scientifically corespondent to
each other, and there were curves and angles artistically
precise. If the reader will place before him
a miniature flag of the Turkish empire, the alignment
of the tenements of the negroes will be seen,
the concave line of the crescent indicating the position
of the modest little houses of the freedmen,
and the star the position of the stately mansion of
Mr. Alexander Wiggins, a former slave of Colonel
Seymour.</p>

<p>Up to the time of this unblushing trespass upon
the private domain of Colonel Seymour, and indeed
afterwards, the negroes, like rodents, had
burrowed in colonies in old dank cellars and where
ever else they could find rest and shelter. This
unhappy condition, post-dating the surrender at
Appomattox, had a demoralizing effect upon them.
They became spiritless and languid, or else vicious
and vindictive. They felt that freedom was
an illusion, an ignis fatuus that they had been
recklessly pursuing, that lured them further into
an impenetrable morass. In the excited state of
their ignorant minds they had been indulging feverish
and extravagant projects; chimerical notions
of wealth and aggrandizement, and again like inert
bodies they would drop lifelessly into the very
depths of despair. It is impossible just now for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
the most active imagination to conceive a condition
of human society more wretched. The sympathies
of the old masters were moved; their humanity
shocked; their very hearts grieved at the injustice
done under the direction of the freedman's bureau
in this violent and forced state of things.</p>

<p>"An outrage," exclaimed the Colonel, "long matured,
maliciously devised, and boldly perpetrated.
Fanatics! you have emancipated by fraud and violence
the slaves you affect to pity; you have doomed
them to beggary, outlawry, prostitution and
crime! You have filled them with discontent and
made them to feel a chain they never felt before,
and turned against them the care and consideration
of their own masters, while your red squadrons
of fanaticism are careering wildly through our
plantations, so lately scourged by the hurricane of
war; you the minions of a power confessedly omnipotent.
Will you, too, destroy the Doric edifice
of our morals, the Corinthian porticoes of our religion,
stifle the denationalizing stream until it swells
in great tides of blood? When the incendiary is
lightning his torch, and the vultures are looking on
with felon eyes, may the holy memories of the
past give you pause."</p>

<p>Thus spoke the old man in the eloquence of
high-wrought feeling, for his country; for the poor
negroes who, like bats and owls, were peopling
dens and holes of darkness in this "land of the
free and home of the brave."</p>

<p>On the night of the 15th of September the elegant
mansion of Mr. Wiggins, the pampered slave
of Laflin, lay smiling and smirking in beautiful
frescoes from turret to foundation stone; astral
lamps hung in rich festoons, shimmered from dome
and window and verandah, lighting up the broad
pebbly avenues that rayed out from the central
vestibule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a night of surprises, of merriment, of
revelry, of rivalries; when the bat and owl came
out of their hollow, the cat out of its lair, the negro
out of his cabin, the ku-klux out of his skin.
It was a night that punctuated reconstruction with
a red-hot iron, and dropped its dead ashes upon a
score of hearth-stones. It was a night that stealthily
removed the fifth wheel from the chariot of the
bosses and dropped its inert body into the road.</p>

<p>Ah! there were surprises! Corporal Ephraim
Gillum was to take unto himself a wife, and Priscilla
Pinxly, a spinster, was to take unto herself
husband. No doleful Jeremiads in this carnival;
no forbidding of banns; no scandal on religion; no
trespass on the law. "Ef dat ar white gal is a mine
ter jine hersef ter dat cullud gemman, who's ergwine
ter hender?"</p>

<p>There were ferns and smilax, hollies and magnolias;
there was an altar embellished with carnations,
red and white; who shall say it was profaned by
this ceremonial? There were heavily groined parlors
reposing in velvety carpets, bric-a-brac and
rugs. Here were the minions of reconstruction in
red, white and blue, the favorites of this institutional
era; here were the animated beauties of the
town bedizened, bejeweled and beflowered; here
was the pompous celebrant in patent-leather slippers
and dress coat, Elder Tuttle, paying court to
the ladies.</p>

<p>Here was the bride, a very spare lady in the
forties, with fishy eyes and gold spectacles. Here
was the groom, as black as an antarctic midnight, reposing
uncomfortably in a celluloid collar that cut
a transverse line through both cheeks, dressed in
blue uniform with yellow epaulets upon his shoulders
as large as sunflowers; here were the bats and
owls, human earth burrowers, who were not wanted
at the wedding supper, peeping slyly in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
windows; here was Mrs. Parthenia Wiggins in silks
and satins, and her lord in satins and silks; here
was Joshua an octogenarian in regimentals, looking
like a revolutionary drum major in masquerade,
greeting the happy hostess with the exclamation:&mdash;"Pend
pon it, your ladyship, I smelt dat barbeku
clean clar to my house fore it was kilt," pausing
now and then in his circuit around the supper
table, to cut "de pigon whing;" here was old
Hannah, in hoops and frills, "er following Joshua,
frustated lak, kase some gal or udder mout run
erway wid him unbeknownist to her;" here was
old Ned "er settin in der chimney corner all by
his lone lorn sef;" and then here was a skeleton
at the feast, a spectre at the banquet, who greeted
neither host, groom or bride&mdash;&mdash;a living knight of
the "White Camelia." Then there was a pause; then
there was a proclamation by the host: "All hands
eround fur de fust kertillien," and there was a
voluntary shuffling of slippered, sandalled and
booted feet. Then the music struck up and all
went merry as a marriage bell. Castanets and
cymbals, cornets and trombones, distributed huge
chunks of melody, chopped off the "Star Spangled
Banner," "Rally around the flag boys," "The Girl
I left behind me," and "Brudder Ephrum got de
coon and gone on."</p>

<p>As the dance went on and on in the great hall
the Kuklux slipped out of the shadows and into
the parlor and concealed himself behind the embowered
altar. Ned, at his suggestion, stole into
the dining room, and taking the cover off of the
basted pig, brought it out and gave it to the
hideous creature, and still the dance went on.
With uplifted hand Mr. Wiggins cried "Tention
ladies und gemman's. All you who's inwited
to the weddin follow me to the parlor," and the
band struck up "Johnny get your gun." "Come
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
parson, you shassay in fust," and the parson struck
out in an Irish reel, and the crowd followed like
flotsam upon a current of water, tossing here and
there, up and down, automatically, to the music.</p>

<p>"Now breddin und sistern," exclaimed the parson
in a nasal sing-song, "range erlong side de
haltar whilst I spaciate upon dis weddin. Now
den, fustly und foremustly, who gin dis bride
away?"</p>

<p>"I does" replied Mr. Wiggins, pompously stepping
to the front.</p>

<p>"Well, den, I'll persede wid de sallymony.
Fustly und foremostly, I'm agwine in my sebenty
seben year, please God I lives to see de harvest
moon, und I has been a exhauster, und locus preacher,
und surkus rider, und slidin elder fust und
last, und I've jined black ones und yallow ones
und yallow ones und black ones, und now I'm
agwine ter jine a white und black one togedder in
de yoke of bondage, und in the bonds of purgertory,
ef I haint upset fore I gits froo by de kommisserys
ob de debbil."</p>

<p>"Land sakes alive!" ejaculated Joshua, as he
brought his hollow jaws together with a resounding
crash, "Don't talk about de kommissery, parson;
I'm hungry rite now."</p>

<p>"Now den, ef der is any pusson or debbil, here
or here erbout, who is agwine to nullify dis weddin,
I commands dem ter hold dere peace foreber
mo."</p>

<p>Instantly a hooded figure of gigantic stature,
clad in a gown of dragons' tongues, with small red
lanterns burning in the socket of his eyes, arose
behind the parson. The audience, first paralyzed
with fear, now gave shriek after shriek which filled
the house, as he gave an unearthly yell and
with the basted pig cudgelled the black parson
over the head as he leaped with a frantic cry into
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
the bosom of the spectacled bride, and then through
glass and shutter out of the window.</p>

<p>"Kuklux! Kuklux!" shrieked the terrified negroes,
as in desperation they fled out of the house.</p>

<p>Joshua, in his frantic efforts to escape, ran his
head against a heated stove and red hot coals of
fire were scattered over rug, carpet and floor. As
the last society lady somersaulted out of the window,
great tongues of fire were lapping up frieze
and cornice, and facade, and the cresent and star
disappeared in a ghastly cincture of fire.</p>

<p>As Jake the Kuklux was passing near the cabin
of Joshua the next morning, on his way to the dark
recesses of the swamp, he heard groans and incoherent
exclamations that caused him to knock at
the door and ask what was the matter. No answer
came, but the groans were louder and more frequent.
He opened the door and entered. Joshua
was lying on the bed swathed in red flannel and
Hannah, with a bandanna tied around her head,
was tossing to and fro in an old rickety chair,
holding her jaw in both hands.</p>

<p>"Hello!" exclaimed the Kuklux, "What ails
you folkses."</p>

<p>"Who dat a woicing dat lamentashun?" cried
Joshua. "Go lang away wid yu white man, I aint
agwine to be pestered," he continued.</p>

<p>"Hi there Aunt Hannah, what ails you?"</p>

<p>"Oh my Lord!" exclaimed Hannah, amid her
groans. "Go lang way frum heer I haint agwine
to put mysef on ekality wid no low down white
trash lak you is." And Hannah kept sea-sawing
in the rickety chair. Jake took a slouching stride
toward the fire-place and making the letter V with
his fingers spat in the fire and accidentally overturned
a stew pan in which two or three small catfish
were cooking.</p>

<p>"Fo my King! white man," exclaimed Hannah
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
wrathfully, "What hes yu gon und dun now? I
wishes yu would stay outen dis house. Now
whar is Joshaway agwine to git his supper er me
udder?"</p>

<p>This lamentation caused Joshua to unswathe the
bandage about his eyes and he groaned louder and
longer. "Dem was de onliest mouffel ob wittles in
dis house, und now me und Hannah hes got ter
suck de fingers twell de good Lord send us mo," he
exclaimed mournfully.</p>

<p>"You lay dar spectin de Lord to send you mo,
und you will be stark naked as a picked ginny
hen," said Hannah.</p>

<p>Jake squinted his right eye as he drawled out:</p>

<p>"You knows Aunt Hannah dat de Lord does feed
his lambs, don't you."</p>

<p>"How cum Joshaway enny of his lambs? Mouter
say he is de debbils old billy gote," answered
Hannah savagely.</p>

<p>"Kase I is one of his lambs," said Joshua. "How
cums I goes to Filadelfy meeting-house ebery
fourth Sunday, und how cums I courages de moners,
und how cums I goes to de baptizin und totes de
passons gown? Tell me dat."</p>

<p>"Ugh! Ugh!" grunted Hannah; "I nebber seed
de lams cutting up sich shines in a grate house lak
yu dun las nite; yu went to de weddin, didn't yu
Joshaway? Und yu seed de kommissery ob de debbil;
did yu see de Lord's lambs dare? und yu set
yo mouf for de barbeku, didn't yu, und yu seed a
harrykane too, didn't yu?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yu go erlong way frum here," said Joshua,
"I natally spises dese heer biggity niggers dat is
tarnally butting up agen de good Lord's jedgements.
You is fell frum grace, dat's what yu done,"
replied Joshua deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"Is?" ejaculated Hannah. "Und yu fell frum
something last nite. What was dat?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now dat dere tantalizing nigger thinks I fell
outen de window, but I clumb down de jice, dat is
what I dun," angrily replied the old negro.</p>

<p>"When you seed de bride und de passon und de
tother lams lak yu, Joshaway? tell me dat!" continued
old Hannah provokingly.</p>

<p>"Nuff sed Hannah, yu dun und sot my po hed er
akin wusser. You is de debbils own billy gote not
me."</p>

<p>Reaching down into his greasy haversack the
Kuklux brought out a great chunk of barbecue,
and flourished it around old Joshua's head like a
musician's baton.</p>

<p>"Dar now Hannah, what I tole yu, you sees
whar my fafe is, don't yu?" said Joshua smiling.
"Don't de Scriptur sez how dat ef yu hes fafe, ef
yu hes fafe," he repeated with emphasis, "you can
tote away mountains, tell me dat?"</p>

<p>"It mout," answered Hannah quizzically, "und
den agin it mout'nt. Do hit say anyfing erbout
barbyku?" continued Hannah, "Tell me dat."</p>

<p>"Oh, go long, nigger," tartly answered Joshua;
"I haint ergwine ter argify de question no mo wid
a debilish nigger dat actally mistrusts de bible; yu
is dun und sot in yo ways, und all Filadelfy church
aint ergwine ter save yu, nudder."</p>

<p>"Not ef it is ergwine ter preach dat dar kind ob
fafe. I wudn't put no pendence in de slidin elder
ef he was to say pine plank dat dat dar barbyku
is in de bible."</p>

<p>"Don't de scriptur say how dat a passel ob horgs
broke er loose outen de gap und run down er hill
und choked up de sea? Tell me dat? Und what does
yu make barbeku outen? Catfishes I spose!" asked
Joshua contemptuously.</p>

<p>Hannah turned her back upon the old negro with
the observation, "You is er black satan kotin de
scriptur."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>And all the time the musician's baton was marking
curves around old Joshua's head, and Joshua's
hollow eyes, as if under the spell of a mesmerist,
were moving mechanically right and left, left and
right, while his great mouth was yawning like a
cavern in a red marl pit.</p>

<p>"Boss," he exclaimed, "ef yu eber specks tu
giv me ary mouful ob dat ar barbyku, fur de
Lawd's sake drap hit rite inter dis heer mouf," and
he brought his old jaws together with a resounding
crash, like an alligator biting at a leaping frog.</p>

<p>The ku-klux, without further teasing, gave the
big chunk of meat to Joshua, who devoured it like
a starved dog.</p>

<p>"Haint yu ergwine ter give me nun?" asked Hannah.</p>

<p>Joshua slowly replied between bites,</p>

<p>"Yu is got er gripin misery now, Hanner, und ef
yu wuz ter your dis peppery stuff und tuck wid a
gripin pain, I'd neber hear de eend ob it. De nex time
I'm ergwine ter give yu a grate big hunk, perwidin
yu haint got no gripin misery ur nuffin," he continued
as he gnawed the last piece of gristle from
the bone.</p>

<p>"Boss," he observed, as he wiped his capacious
mouth, "ef I hadn't bin ticed erway by dat nigger
sea-sawin ober dar, I wudn't er bin in dis heer fixment.
De women fokeses fotched de debil in dis
heer wurld, und bress de Lawd when dey is ceasded
dey is ergwine ter take him erlong wid dem. Does
yer see how slak-sided I'se got? Look at dese ole
holler eyes; yu kin jamby play marbles in dem.
I'm ergwine rite strate back ter ole marser, lak dat
progigle man in de scriptur, und I'm ergwine ter
tell him he mout hab my freedom. I'd ruther hab
de tarrifyin fever dan be a franksized woter. I
wishes ole Laflin had er died fo' he wuz born, upsottin
de niggers, und dey ergwine erbout lak ragged
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>

knows dis ole stractified nigger hes sucked misery
long ernuff. I haint neber node ole marser ter
turn his back on nobody, und es fur Miss Alice,
her purty white hans is wide open all de time, und
she do say 'Uncle Joshaway' de hebenliest I eber
seed."</p>

<p>With these heartfelt expressions the old negro
maintained a dead silence, and Hannah, like the
Temanite of old, essayed to answer,</p>

<p>"Yu needn't blame it all on me, dat yu needn't.
Enybody er seein yu er wourin up dat grate big
hunk o' meat mout hab node yu wuz er horgish
nigger, und hit maks no diffunce who parishes so
yo stumick is full. Er lyin dar now er pickin yo

und me er settin here er fairly rackin wid mizry."</p>

<p>"Hush Hannah," interrupted Joshua, "nuff is
nuff, ef yu had er wourd dat barbyku und tuck
defly sick, dar wudn't been no sleep in dis house
dis nite. 'Twant kase I hankered fo dat leetle
grain ob fresh meat dat I didn't wide wid yu, twas
kase I knowd it was gwine gin yo stummick."</p>

<p>"Bress God," answered Hannah, "you's er powerful
doctor, er puttin yo mouf on sick folkses dat
is peert und harty," and Hannah began sea-sawing
again.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

<h3>THE WRIT OF EJECTMENT.</h3>


<p>Shortly after the events narrated in the last
chapter, the announcement was made by Clarissa
that a white man, "und dat biggety nigger Ellic,
was at de do to see ole marser." The interview
occurred on the verandah.</p>

<p>Abram Laflin, the carpet-bagger, introduced the
subject as follows:</p>

<p>"I observed" said he, "in passing the court
house on yesterday, that you had advertised my
home to be sold to pay a debt of five thousand
dollars due you. Will you be kind enough to
make the calculation and inform me what is due
you, principal and interest?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I will, with great pleasure," replied
the Colonel. "Here is the account accurately computed."</p>

<p>"Make your calculations, Mr. Wiggins, and see if
the gentleman is correct," he said to the negro.</p>

<p>Mr. Wiggins adjusted his gold rimmed eyeglasses,
fingered a moment the gold chain upon
his immaculate shirt bosom, scratched his head a
time or two with the point of his gold pencil and
passed the statement to his lord and master.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha," exclaimed the carpet-bagger, "Four
thousand three hundred and fifty-seven dollars and
thirty-three and one-third cents, and not five thousand
dollars as you have it, Mr. Seymour."</p>

<p>"Ah, very well" replied Mr. Seymour "You may
settle by my calculation if you wish, if not the sale
shall go on."</p>

<p>"Give me the paper and pencil, Mr. Wiggins, I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
will make the calculation for myself," said the
carpet-bagger. "The result as you have it sir, is
correct. Here is your money sir."</p>

<p>"Now, sir, I will show you the gate," replied
the Colonel with asperity. "Good morning," and
the two men locked arms and went away.</p>

<p>As the enraged man was entering the verandah,
he was greeted unexpectedly and obsequiously by
Joshua, with "Compliments, ole Marser. I have
fotched you some long-necked gode seeds; spected
yer would lak to hab dem, mars Jon."</p>

<p>"Yes, Yes, I am glad you remembered me Joshua.
I thought my old slave had quite forgotten
me," replied the Colonel.</p>

<p>"You mout hab spected dat ole masser, but I
knowed all de time you wus de onliest fren I had
in de wurrell," answered the old negro.</p>

<p>"I am surprised to see you looking so badly,
Joshua. Why your hair is as white as cotton,
and your clothes too are ragged and dirty, and
there are great hollows in your cheeks; what have
you done with yourself old man?"</p>

<p>The old negro dashed a great big tear from each
eye as he replied hesitatingly, "Better ax tother
fokeses dat ar questun, ole marsa; better ax de
bosses at de kommissery; I'se been froo de froos
sens I seed you sar, mommucked up monstrus, dat
I is. Dem dar pizen'd carpet-baggers tole us cullud
fokses ef we didn't do jess lak dey sed, dat dey
was agwine to put us bak in slavery, und dey
skeert us jam ni to def, dat dey did. Dey uprared
a grate big sto in de town, und sakes alive! de
moest lasses und horg meat und flower und backer,
und sich lak yu nebber did see, mars Jon, und
likker, too; und wun ob de bosses he cum to de do
und sez, sez he boys, fetch yer happysaks und
jimmyjons ebery Tuesday, und eberry Saddy nite
de Lord sens und fill dem chok full. I clar marser,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
I felt jess lak I wus in Paradise, wid de angels
er harpin pon golden harps und soppin lasses;
und I took dat white man at his word, und I'se
been on de rode twixt my house und de sto fur
seben weeks, backards und forrards, a totin my
ole jimmyjon un happy-sak; I clar pon my Marser
in Heben, I haint eben got de rappins ob my finger

rashuns had gin out fore I got dere, und to cum

in my house fur me nur Hanner nudder, und we
bof a perishin to def. Ole marsa, hain't yer got
nary ole ash tater, nur a leetle piece ob meat skin
yer kin gib dis ole darky jess to pacify his stummik,
seems lak I jess hab to draw my galluses rale
tite roun it to keep it frum creepin fru my mouf."</p>

<p>The old soldier of fifty battles looked down upon
the poor old negro in his squalor and emaciation
and wretchedness, and the tears came into his eyes,
too, as he said,</p>

<p>"If there is anything in this house to eat, Joshua,
you shall have all you want. I pity you from
my heart, old negro. These people are not your
friends nor mine. The day will come when you
will know them as they are&mdash;enemies of every one
who will not wash their dirty linen."</p>

<p>"Eber yu spoke de truf, Mars Jon, you spoke it
den&mdash;hit's de God's truf."</p>

<p>"Clarissa!" called the Colonel, "Clarissa!"</p>

<p>"Sar!" came Clarissa's voice from the kitchen.
"I'se er cummin, ole marsa, jes es fast es I ken."</p>

<p>As she saw Joshua she threw up her hands and
impulsively exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Fur de Lawd's sake, Joshaway, whot do ail yer
eny way? I faut yu wuz er gostis er settin outen
here wid ole marser. Po ole nigger! Duz sis Hanner
luk lak yu duz? De grabeyard is er yornin fer yu
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
rite now." And Clarissa placed her hand feelingly
upon the old negro's white head, saying the while,
"Po Joshaway! Po nigger!" while Joshua covered
his face with his knotty hands and his feeble body
shook as with a spasm.</p>

<p>In obedience to orders, Clarissa placed before
Joshua a huge dish of boiled ham, cabbage, potatoes&mdash;Irish
and sweet&mdash;and the old negro in the
joy of his heart sprang nimbly to his aged and
aching feet and "cut de piggen whing jes ter sho
ole marsa how spry und suple he wus."</p>

<p>"Bress Gawd!" he gratefully exclaimed, "I'se
been happy two times in my life&mdash;wun time when
I jined de miluntary cumpny when de niggers wus
playin 'de jay bird' on der tootin horns (den I wus
er fule), und tother time wus dis here time."</p>

<p>After devouring like a starved brute the bulk of
the food before him, he considerately placed into
his old beaver hat choice bits and fragments, layer
upon layer, with the observation,</p>

<p>"I wudn't er tasted a moufful o' dis good truck
ef I hadn't er node Hanner wuz ergwine ter git
her shar. Jes er watchin me now lak a sparrer
hawk er settin on er lim! Tank yer a fousun times,
ole marser! Tank yu, too, sis Clarsy; tank eberybody
in de whole wurld. Ole marsa," he continued,
"mout I hab jes wun wurd wid yer?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, Joshua; what more can I do
for you?" asked the old man.</p>

<p>The old negro put his hand to his face as if he
were shielding his eyes, and asked sheepishly,</p>

<p>"Mars Jon, ef me und Hanner wus ter turn niggers
ergin, jes lak slabery times, wud yer tuck us
home&mdash;yu und Miss Alice?"</p>

<p>"I would not have you do that, Joshua; but
whenever you like, you and Hannah can bring your
belongings to the office and Alice and I will always
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
be your friends. You shall never suffer any more
for something to eat or wear as long as we live."</p>

<p>"Tank yer, ole marser, tank yu, a fousand
times!" Joshua replied, as he brushed away great
liquid beads that were chasing each other down his
haggard cheeks. "Now I mus be ergwine, Mars
Jon," and the old stiffened joints bore homeward
a filled body and a full heart, as he sang in an untuned
but sweet voice,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh de way's so delightful when I sarves de Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh de way's so delightful, journey on."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As the sun was going down the old Colonel looked
across the field and saw Joshua and Hannah
with great bundles upon their heads coming toward
the mansion&mdash;coming back to the old home;
coming back to be just as humble, just as faithful,
just as watchful as in the happy old days; coming
back to run errands if need be, with joints stiffened
by hardships and old age, but with hearts so
light and trustful; coming back like homing pigeons
to roost under old master's wing in the dove
cote. Was there ever such a people before? The
sweetest experience in the domesticity of the South
will vanish forever when the last old white woolly
head is laid low, when the ghostly smile is given
to old mistress from the death bed, and the last
good-bye is said to "ole marser und ole missis" as
the death film overlays the eye. "Tak keer ob
yosefs, ole marser und ole missis, und meet me up
yander." So thought the old master as with liquid
eyes he looked upward to the vaulted sky.</p>

<p>"Seben weeks" the old negro weighted down by
the ever accumulating burdens of life&mdash;its disappointments,
its troubles&mdash;had with unsteady gait
and frequent halts stepped off each rod and furlong
twixt "my house und de sto, backards und
forards, toting de jimmyjon und de happy-sak."
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
"Fur seben weeks" the torrid sun with its blistering
heat had scorched the old negro's head, and crisped
the old negro's black skin until it was spotted.
For seven weeks a vacuum deep and broad lay between
the inner coatings of the famished stomach
immeasurable and unfathomable. For seven weeks
"Old Glory" waved its welcome at one end of the
commissariat, and stark, pallid want walked out
without a ration and flaunted its rags at the other.
Poor old negro, but what worth is freedom without
its pains and penalties; what worth is the
huge commissariat without the freedmen, and what
worth is the freedmen without the commissariat?
Oh how happy the old negro in "de offis of ole
marser." By fits and starts old Joshua would
awake throughout the nights and call to Hannah,
"Ole womun, duz yer kno whar yer is a roosting
to night? Aint agwine to de crick fur catfish in de
mornin. I kno whar my wittles is er cummin frum,
bress de Lord. Cum rain ur shine, I haint nebber
agwine hongry agin, no mo. Old marsa dun und
said, ole nigger yer shall nebber want fur sumfing
to eat und sumfing to ware no mo, und I nebber
cotched ole Mars Jon in a lie yit. Has yu, Hanner?"</p>

<p>"No, dat I haint, nur Miss Alice nudder," replied
Hannah. "I haint got no mo skeer erbout
me, Joshaway, dan a billy gote. I kno's when
Miss Alice flings a dumplin in de pot for hersef, she
is agwine to fling wun in dare fur me too."</p>

<p>"Pears lak, Hanner, I kin heer my stummick
ebery now und den nachully singing de ole ship ob
Zion, hit is so full ob ole marser's good wittles."</p>

<p>Bright and early the next morning the old negro
was standing in the wide open door of the
office, swinging his arms in exercise like a prize
fighter, and occasionally "cuttin de piggen whing
out of doors," as he said, "dat yung misses mout
see how he could twist his foots erbout." As he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
was skipping about the yard he discovered as it
were, a moccasin snake; a red, white, and blue
stake about two feet long in the ground near the
office, and he knew what it was and called in a fit
of rage to Hannah. "Jess cum und see what dem
dratted niggers has dun gon und dun. Lord a massy!
Duz dem pizened willians fink dey kin oberride
dis here plantashun wid me, und Ned, und
ole marsa, und yung misses, und yu und Claissy a
fendin for deselvs? I'se agwine to lode up my
muskit dis bery nite, und de fust nigger dat cums
pestering our white fokses on dis here lan, I'se
agwine to shoot two pounds of hot led into his karkas.
Tak dis ole streked striped stick, Hanner,
und burn it up," and he jerked the peg out of the
ground as if it had been an aching molar in his
gum, and threw it violently into the fire-place.</p>

<p>"Who upon de yurth did fetch dese pizened
stiks on dis lan? I'm ergwine er roun dis yer plantashun,
und maybe I'll fine sum mo ob de ring-streeked-und-striped
things, er painted jes like 'ole
Glory' out yander in de town, jes ter fool niggers
und git dem sassinated lak er passel o' polecats."</p>

<p>While Joshua was making the "grand rounds"
over the plantation a carriage with a pair of beautiful,
high-stepping horses rolled up to the door,
and two "gemmen of culler" alighted and walked
with unnatural dignity to the door and rang the
bell. Clarissa, of course, obeyed the call, and in
their presence was so bewildered that she asked
them into the library. Placing into her hands their
cards <i>de visite</i>, upon which were written the names
of the "Hon. Alexander Wiggins" and the "Hon.
Ephraim Gillam," she carried them to Colonel Seymour.</p>

<p>Instantly the devil was aroused in the old man,
and he told Clarissa to tell them to get out of the
house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>Clarissa, in executing the order, said, "Ole marser
says how dat yu niggers must go back out er
doors. Jes tak yosef outen dis house immegit."
Then upon recognizing one of the negroes, she enquired,
"Haint dat yer Ellick, wid dem fine close
und shoes, und gold specks, und bever hat, comin
into dis house lak yer was a king, or a gineral, or
sumfing I don't kno what? What is yer doing
here in ole marser's house, anyhow? I specks yer
is up to sum devilment rate now."</p>

<p>"My name is not Ellic, replied the negro, und I
am not up to devilment. I am de prieter ob dis
manshun house, und my stinguished friend, Mr.
Ephrum Gillum und me, hez cum to sarv a rit ob
jectment upon Mr. Semo fortwid."</p>

<p>"Lord hab marcy upon my soul!" exclaimed
Clarissa in great excitement, "Ef yer sarves dat
dar fing on ole marsa, dares gwine to be a ressurreckshun
in dis grate house fortwid, yer haint
agwine to lib to git bak to town. You und dat
udder nigger better tak yerselvs offen dis lan fore
marser sees yer; he spises yer worse den eny mocksin
snake in de crick, und yer nose it."</p>

<p>"Ah, well," the negro replied arrogantly, "Yu
jess gib him dis writ ob 'jectment und tell him dat
Mr. Wiggins und his lady will return ter-morrer
ebenin at ate o'clock und tak persesshun, und see
dat yu prepars a bed in de best chamber in dis
mansion fur him."</p>

<p>"Jes yer fling dat pizen fing on de flo. I aint
ergwine ter mess my hans up wid no sich nasty
trash, und yer tak yersefs offen here&mdash;don't I'm
agwine ter set Jube on yer, yer hateful creetur.
Ugh! ef yer gits anyfing pared on dis plantashun
hit's ergwine ter be a ded-fall ter kill yu cussed
niggers. Dat's de bed yer is ergwine ter git ter morrer
at ate o'clock, 'member dat! Ugh! I specks
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
when dat time cums yer will be ded und gon rite
strait ter torment."</p>

<p>Clarissa seized the tongs and prodded the document
upon the floor as if it had been a tarantula,
then holding it at arm's length, muttering the
while like a savage, brought it to Colonel Seymour
with the observation,</p>

<p>"Mars Jon, yer mout as well gib up dis grate
house und de plantashun, too, to de stinkin, outdashus
niggers, don't dey is ergwine ter tarrify de
life outen yer, und me too."</p>

<p>To this the old man deigned no reply, but unfolding
the paper and reading it, he concluded
there was but one thing to be done. For one-third
of a century he had been a highly respected communicant
in the Episcopal church; orthodox and
consistent in his views and observances, but upon
reading the insulting document he swore like "our
army in Flanders."</p>

<p>"Clarissa," he exclaimed, "bring me my pistols.
I will defend my own with my life, and"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mars Jon," interrupted Clarissa, "I'se skeert
ob dem dar shootin iruns. What is yer ergwine
ter do, ole marser? Is yer ergwine ter hab a resurreckshun
in de grate house? Sposin yer und young
missis gits kilt&mdash;whot in de name ob Gawd is ergwine
ter cum ob tother ones? Sarve Ellick rite ef
he gits masskreed; but sposin yer und Ned gits
kilt, whot is ergwine ter cum ob me und Miss Alice?
Yer is too brash, ole marser."</p>

<p>The old soldier was quiet for a moment, and then
he called Ned to him.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mars Jon, here I is, sar. Whot yer want
now, Mars John?" Ned asked humbly.</p>

<p>"Go and tell Mr. Jake Flowers to come here at
once."</p>

<p>"Sartinly, Sar, mejitly, Mars Jon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>And in a short time Mr. Flowers, accompanied
by Ned, saluted the Colonel with,</p>

<p>"What are your orders for to-day, sir?"</p>

<p>Now, thought the Colonel, I shall marshal a
force more terrible than an army with banners. I
shall recruit my regiment from the "Invincible
Empire," and I shall tear down and let them reconstruct
if they can. "We will march to victory under
the flag of the 'White Camelia,' shall we not,
Mr. Flowers?" asked the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Well, when I wants to play demnation wid ther
niggers, I don't fight under no other," was the sententious
answer of the regulator.</p>

<p>"Come into my library a moment, sir."</p>

<p>As the regulator was ambling along he put his
two fingers to his mouth and accidentally(?) expectorated
"ambeer" in the eye of old Jupiter, the
fox hound, which set up a prolonged howl and
caused Clarissa to exclaim with great warmth;</p>

<p>"Mars Jon, did yer see dat ou'dashus white man
a spettin dat dar backer juce in ole Jube's tother
eye? Wun ob dem is outen now, und I specks dat
fafefulest ole dorg will go plum blind. He is de
fafefulest creetur on dis hole plantashun. Po' ole
Jube! Nebber mind, Clarsy is ergwine ter set yer
on dat speckled-face white man when he cums outen
dat do, und is ergwine ter give yu sum mo wittles
ef yer chaws him good. Po' ole Jube!" And
Clarissa walked back into the kitchen with Jube
following her, with the further observation, "Twixt
de niggers und de low-down white trash I haint
got no chusen&mdash;hit's a half duzzen wun way und a
half duzzen tother way, und de debbil tak de diffunce."</p>

<p>The Colonel drew a chair up to the table and
asked the regulator to be seated.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow night at eight o'clock sharp I will
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
take possession of Ingleside, peaceably if I can,
forcibly if I must."</p>

<p>"When the Prince of the Thebaird sent this message
to the queen of lower Egypt, "Tomorrow I will
knock at the door of your palace with the hilt of
my spear," she returned this warning, "And I will
welcome you with bloody hands, and the crocodiles
of the Nile shall devour your carcass."</p>

<p>"What shall be our message, Mr. Flowers?"</p>

<p>The regulator thought a little dreamily for
awhile, and then with the usual squint in the right
eye replied drowsily,</p>

<p>"Wall, thar is two ways to kill a nigger unbeknownst
to him. I kin ku-klux him, or I kin
strike him with forked litenin; but I haint got ammunition
enuff to kill a hole passul at wunce."</p>

<p>The Colonel unfolded and laid upon the table a
large sheet of paper, such as engineers use in diagramming,
and began in a perfunctory way to mark
off lines, angles, eccentric and concentric figures,
until he fixed the point of his pencil suspiciously
at the upper abutment of a bridge that spanned
a rivulet, with this remark,</p>

<p>"Just here, sir, must be the point of attack.
This is the only defensible position upon the plantation.
If the malicious negroes pass this bridge,
all is lost. Now, my friend," he continued, "heroic
diseases must be healed with heroic remedies.
You and I are old soldiers. Up and down the
Chickahominy our army would have been tin soldiers
but for our sappers and miners. Now you
may sap and mine to your heart's content," he
said jocularly. "Do you understand, Mr. Flowers?"</p>

<p>"No, not eggzactly," replied Flowers. "Dos yer
want ther cussed niggers drounded?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, only frightened so they will let me alone,"
replied the Colonel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>"Frightened!" ejaculated the regulator. "Wall,
fokeses in gineral gits frightened before they gits
drounded, don't they? If I don't mistrust you, Kernel,
you wants the bridge upsot, and then you
wants the kerridge upsot, and then you wants the
blamed niggers upsot, altogether in the crick."</p>

<p>"If in your opinion my language bears that construction,
you may proceed," said the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Eggzactly so," replied the regulator. "I may
percede with another percession and a funeral at
the tail eend of it. Eight o'clock, sharp!" reiterated
the regulator, and waving his hand backwards
at the old man in the verandah, cried back, "I will
be thar or thar abouts," took his leave.</p>

<p>Clarissa tried to sick "ole Jube" on the regulator
as he passed through the gate, but the old dog
looked sheepishly into Clarissa's face and wagged
his tail, as much as to say, "Ef yer wants enybody
sicked on dat white man, jes sick yersef."</p>

<p>Nero never planned the destruction of Rome, nor
Titus the destruction of Jerusalem with a more
implacable spirit then did the regulator the destruction
of the upper abutment of the wooden
bridge on the Ingleside plantation. As the bold
man stood upon the bridge contemplating the work
to be done, and then upon the cold full orbed moon
bathing its face in light, cumulus clouds, and then
on the cold waters, he said to himself; "A soldier
boy that can climb the elements in the Crater fight
and butt his head agin the stars, aint pestered by
little diffikilties when it comes to drownin niggers."</p>

<p>He threw off his coat, took up the crowbar and
went to work. The apron was then propped up
upon skids too weak to bear the weight of a carriage,
but so skillfully as to ward off suspicion in
case the structure or any part of it should fall. At
7:30 sharp the work was done and completely done,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
the pitfall was laid, and well laid, and at 7:40 a
black cavalcade, noisy and ruffianly, were galloping
on the way to take by force actual possession
of Ingleside, against the emphatic protest of its
owner and against the law of the land. They were
marching with their trombones and their flags,
flags striped and starred, just like the one that
laughed in the faces of the starved negroes that
marched in platoons, desperately hungry, out of
the back doors of the Commissariat. Just like the
one ruffian Laflin wrapped about his beastly person
when he said to poor oppressed Seymour, "My
freedmen may make reprisals whenever they please
in this accursed country." Just like the flag that
waved from the stern sheets of the batteau, that
cold sleety night, when Washington was cutting
the ice out of his way upon the Delaware. Just
like the "Old Glory" that Ethan Allen wound
around his head at Ticonderoga. Just like the
flag that thrilled every heart, that Philip Barton
Key immortalized in the first battle hymn of the
Republic.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tis the Star Spangled Banner long may it wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the land of the free and the home of the brave."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Ah, no," the Southern patriot would say "Our
hot sun has tarnished its bright stars, has made
black and dingy the blue field, and see! it is blushing
ever so red, as it is made to accentuate the horrors
of reconstruction." But the flags were coming,
so were the horses, and so were the negroes,
and so were the trombones, and so was death,
each in a vain attempt to bridge the chasm before 8
o'clock sharp. Ah, that crash, that shriek, that
doom! The affrightened horses break from the descending
carriage and scamper like zebras into the
open fields of Ingleside. The uniformed escort
turn their horses heads and scamper toward the
town, even the trombones have ceased to sound
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
now, but there are echoing hoofs, and there are the
wails of the dying, coming up from the darkened
abyss, and the moon is still bathing its face in the
watery clouds overhead. What! art thou a prophetess,
Clarissa, that thou shouldst have said "I
specks when dat time cums yer will be ded and
gone rate strait to torment?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

<h3>THE CORONER'S INQUEST.</h3>


<p>The revolutionary iconoclasts had fully established
their sway in the worst and most irritating
forms; their resources, directed by irresponsible
and offensive authority&mdash;controlling the fortunes,
hopes and fate of all classes&mdash;ramified and extended
throughout the South. Mountebanks sat in
judgment upon the lives and liberties of a vanquished
people; everywhere violating all the guaranties
of freedom. The alarming vibrations of this
unhallowed power were felt in every home. It was
a matter of anxious and fearful thought, "What
must be the result of collisions that are sure to
come?" It were vain to threaten consequences
badgered as the people were into passive submission
by a power that ruled supreme&mdash;a power that
was conducting its operations with unmeasured
cruelty wherever the ill-starred Confederacy had
raised its hated crest. Retaliation swift and sure
pursued a few of the misguided negroes whose
black hands were upraised to smite the South.
Now and then, under the shadow of the citadel
that was garrisoned by the pensioned slaves, the
victims of the murderous knife or deadly bullet
would be found. Hence the South was the harvest
field for the functionaries who delighted in the
sudden visitations of Providence, and who looked
for the vultures upon circling pinions above the
river as couriers of cheering messages; in the language
of the negroes, as the "sky sheruffs" who
served due notice upon the oppressed taxpayers of
this patronizing government of the freedmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>By a custom that obtained very generally in the
South in the post-bellum days, there was a division
of offices inequitably made, however, between
the carpet-baggers and the negroes; and to the negroes
was assigned among others of inconsiderable
revenue, the office of county coroner. This office
for many generations before the war was a sinecure,
but a pictorial page now appears in the history
of reconstruction, electrotyped in disgusting
caricatures. The office of coroner was constructed
out of a mediæval original; it was both ancient and
honorable&mdash;a remnant of the feudal system that
superseded other forms of government in Europe
before and since the crusade. So considerable were
its revenues and dignity, that the lords chief justices
of the King's Bench of England coveted and
enjoyed its emoluments and title; and to descend
from an antiquity so dignified and remote, from
bewigged and begowned lords justices to 15th
amendment freedmen, was quite a sheer descent.
But reconstruction came with fantastical ideals;
with its own peculiar and irritating forms and institutions,
and the political fabric was ludicrously
inverted and the freedmen appeared to walk
through the air on stilts.</p>

<p>When post-mortem investigations were exceedingly
rare in a county that boasted of its healthfulness
and its obedience to law, the per diem of
the coroner was fixed by legislative enactment to
ten dollars, with certain enumerated charges, such
as summoning, swearing and empanelling the jury
of inquest. But now there was an epidemic of accidental
deaths in this phenomenal era. Among
the negroes the most natural thing was to die&mdash;to
die from exposure, from starvation, and sometimes
from heroic doses of manhood suffrage. They died
in the river, in the creek, in the lowgrounds. Old
Uncle Elijah Thorpe, the coroner, would sit moodily
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
by the hour on his dilapidated stoop, intently
gazing into the firmament above him for the appearance
of "de sky shurruff," and when the circling
scavengers of the country would flap and dip
their pinions below the fringe of the cypresses
that bordered the river, his spirits would revive,
and refreshing smiles would play hide and seek in
the black caverns of his face.</p>

<p>The old coroner like Judge Blackstock, appeared
to be the "survival of the fittest." He had come
out of the toils of slavery with his hair as white
as the snow, and with lines in his black face as
if a "new ground plow" had been running furrows
into it. He was an old man when the great
guns were celebrating the emancipation of four million
slaves. He was an old man when the bosses
placed into his horny, gouty hand the elective franchise.
He was an old man when he looked out one
night, when the stars were twinkling in the mid-heavens,
and saw the luminary of freedom with its
bewildering corruscations. He was the advanced
guard of the freedmen who welcomed the agent of
the bureau with waving of hats and clapping
of resounding hands. He was the file leader of
Laflin's black reinforcements. When Elijah began
to grow rich out of the spoils of his office he
observed in a confidential way to Laflin,</p>

<p>"Ef de niggers keeps er gitten sassinated lak
deys agwine on und de jurer don't gin out, dis
heer Soufland is agwine ter be a sametary from one
eend to de tother; the buzzards is lak a passel ob
rode hands er cummin und agwine," and then to
disarm the carpet-bagger's cupidity he continued
with a lugubrious cast of countenance, "By de time
I gits de rashuns from de kommissery und de sperrits
fur de jurer dars a mity leetle spec left ob de
poreseeds. De pay boss haint ekal to de sponsuality
of de offis."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>These post-mortem inquiries, like all other
functions of the time, presented most ridiculous
contrasts. While the circling carrion crows were
looking for dead negroes in the river and swamps,
the negro women in the cabins and kitchens were
watching the movements of the coroner; and whenever
the public became advised "dat de corps ob
humans was to be sot upon" if the news came in
the dead of the night, an outcry would go from
cabin to cabin; dusky faces would appear at dirty
windows and an inquiry in staccato from some sister
would arouse her neighbour.</p>

<p>"Oh! Sophia Ann, has yu heerd de news, or is yu
pine blank ded? De crowner has dun und put de
saddle on ole 'sametary' und de saddle-bags und
de jimmyjon too, und agwine ter set on er corps
fortwid."</p>

<p>"Hush! sister Becky," would come the answer;
"Aint you got anudder tack of hystericks;" and
rayless jaundiced lights would appear in windows;
then the screeching of fowls in the coops, then
pots would simmer and boil; then little Bill would
be jerked out of bed with the angry exclamation,
"Fore de King, I believes dis heer yungun would
sleep clar froo de jedgment day und wudn't heer
nary trumpet. Git outen heer yu Bill und fetch
dat ar steer und de kaart fore de door fortwid."
And then Bill, yawning and gaping and grunting,
and twisting his arms over his black head, would
stagger with tangled feet to the stable and command,</p>

<p>"Cum outen dis heer door ole Linkum fore I
whacks yu ober de hed wid dis heer palin." And
then old Linkum would toss his head and start
towards Bill with a boo&mdash;o-o and then back into
his stall with another boo-oo, and then Maria
would shout from the kitchen,</p>

<p>"Yu Bill has yu und ole Linkum gone plum ter
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
sleep? Why don't yu fetch dat aggrawating steer
outen dar?" And then she would turn to pack
away the pies and chickens in the basket, and then
ole Linkum and Bill and Maria and "Ladybird,"
the ugly fice dog, would be reinforced upon the
road by a picturesque caravan. There would be
women and children of all sizes, ages and conditions;
then the hard cider carts, fakirs and pie women,
then the old parson and the deacons and the
singing sisters, then the man with a hand organ
and a monkey, then a score of yelping hounds,
curs and fices, then the coroner in battered beaver
and green goggles, astride his flopped-eared, flee-bitten
mule, "ole Samitary," all with laughter, jest
and song hurrying to the scene of the catastrophe;
while the poor misguided subjects of the investigation
would be staring with great lack-lustre eyes
into the sky.</p>

<p>Upon this occasion the rising sun as he passed
through the mist veiled his face from a spectacle
terribly ghastly. Four black corpses in silks and
satins and tawdry lace, with upturned faces, lay
rigid with a seasaw motion in the ooze and water;
and a huge black object, like the back of a leviathan
with striped banners in his nostrils, dammed
up the stream that flowed with a sluggish current
from the river. This then was the end of the carnival;
the due return upon the writ of ejectment.</p>

<p>What utopian dreams were whispered into ears
into which the eddying waters were intoning a refrain!
Shall the mistress of Ingleside descend into
this cold, forbidding flood with the keys of her
broad domain, and place them as a symbolical delivery
of title into hands so rigid and nerveless,
that never guarded its portals with one night's vigil?
Shall the officers of the law, under these
broken arches, endorse a due return upon the writ
of ejectment? When we see the star spangled
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
banner down there, dyeing the waters as it seemed
with blood, "with the Union" down, does it bind
us to an allegiance to the powers that sent these
outlaws upon their mission of assassination.</p>

<p>Joshua was very wretched when he heard of the
horrifying disaster that overreached the human
beagles that were pursuing their quarry so heartlessly.
Old negroes like Joshua and Ned were
fast becoming disillusioned; they had danced attendance
to Laflin and his pampered slaves when
they were desperately hungry; they had marched
and counter marched, when from sheer weakness
they could scarcely keep step to the fife and drum;
they had seen the hollow pageantry; had heard the
discordant fanfares from brazen trumpets; the mockery
of commands to "fall in" and to "fall out;" indeed
they had been lashed to the treadmill of fatiguing
servitude when there wasn't a bazaar or a sutler's
shop into which they could enter and beg a morsel
of bread; and when they "broke ranks" there wasn't
a ration of meat or flour distributed to the old hulks
that were to all intents and purposes out of commission.
Joshua felt that all the events and catastrophes
of this mortal life were in some mysterious
way the annotations of Sacred Writ, and hence
as he clothed himself in the spic-span homespun
garments that Alice had given him, he said to his
wife,</p>

<p>"Now eff I kin ever find my old bever, und my
specks, I'm agwine to ax Miss Alice what de
scriptur says erbout dis insurreckshun. Cording to
my membrance when de Mallyskites flung ole Farro
outen de charryot into de sea, dat Fillisten ginril
was imitating Ellick in his devilishness; haint
dat scriptur, Hannah?"</p>

<p>Hannah looked up from her wash-board with
earnestness and with just a suggestion of temper
as she observed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whicherway in de scriptur duz yu find dat
passage? Cordin to my membrance dare want none
of dem charryots in dem deys epsepting Lijah's,
und hit warn't hitched to no hosses."</p>

<p>As Joshua was going toward the mansion he said
to himself, "Dey is agwine to spishun ole marsa
wid killing dem niggers, und den de werry ole
harrykin is gwine to brake loose in dis plantashun.
Grate Jarryko! Ef it cums to de wursest me und
Ned und Clarsy und Hanna is agwine to stan twixt
him und dem twell de eend."</p>

<p>It appears to be exclusively the prerogative of
women to be the burden bearers for others; assuredly
this virtue was heroically exercised by
the beautiful girl, whose heart was all sympathy for
the misguided wretches. Not one thought, not a
care, for her poor, defenceless self; all for the negroes
who were drunken upon the lees of reconstruction,
the poor slaves of a power they dared
not oppose.</p>

<p>"Uncle Joshua," she asked in tears "Have you
heard the sad fate of Aleck and Ephraim?"</p>

<p>"Yes, marm, I dun und heerd de news dis mornin
fo sun up, und I'm missurble fur yer und ole
marsa, missis. Dis werry sassinashun cum to my
membrunce las nite twixt lebben 'clock und day,
und when hit wuz fust norated er roun, I ses ter
Hanner, sez I, Dar now! I spishuned dat werry
axydent wuz ergwine ter happ'n. Und Hanner she
ups und sez, sez she, 'How cum yer node mo dan
tuther humans? Is yer er possel ur a wangel?' Und
den I upped und tole her, und hit cum erbout in
disser fashun, missis: A bitter sadness lay upon
my piller las nite, yung missis, und way in de
shank o' de nite I seed yo precious mammy, und
she wur er weepin lak her po hart wud brake, und
I sed to her, sez I, 'Ole missis, haint dat yu?' Und
den she smoled one leetle smole, und den she sed,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
sez she, 'Ole nigger, I'm so missurble, for my dear
husbun und my preshus child are in danger; won't
yu help em?' Und den she pinted her lily finger
down de appenu toards de crick, and den I heerd
her say, sez she, 'Rite dare is whar de niggers is
ergwine ter kill my po dears;' und den she banished
lak a sperret outen my site. Fo Gawd, yung
missis, dem dar wurds sont a shower ob isickles
all ober me."</p>

<p>This simple, affecting narrative chilled the heart
of poor Alice, too, and her grief became as frigid
as if smitten by polar frosts.</p>

<p>Oh, what would Alice give for the reign of
peace, of law in this Idumea of the South! "Why
prepare these watery sepulchres for the freedmen
whose hopes have been built upon their delusive
pledges? Why starve and drown them as if they
were vermin, without aspirations and without souls?
Who can excel these authors of misrule in the
fine art of assassination?" she asked.</p>

<p>Clarissa stood at the side of her young mistress,
whilst Joshua, as if by inspiration, was narrating
the vision of the night. She was transfixed with
terror, and shaking from head to foot she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Bress Gawd! dis is de eend ob hit all&mdash;fust cums
de belliun, den de hosses und de charryot, den
def!"</p>

<p>"Stop rite dar! Stop rite dar, Clarsy! Nary nudder
wurd," exclaimed Joshua with emphasis.
"Don't de scriptur say how dat whot is ergwine
ter cum is ergwine ter cum? Und ef hit haint er
gwine ter cum hit haint ergwine ter cum; why,
in cose; ef me und Ned hez ary grane ob spishun

house, und dey will be drib back lak de Mallyskites.
Yu jess hole yer gripe upon Proverdense
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
und grace, Clarsy, und den we kin fling de charryots
und de hosses in de creek agen, und ole marser
und yung missis will be saved."</p>

<p>"Grate king!" replied Clarissa, still greatly
alarmed. "Yu mout ez well uprare dat barrykade
rite now; kase when dem niggers sees dese drounded
corpses er see-sawin in de creek, day is ergwine
ter cum down on dis hear grate house same ez de
yaller flies on dem pided steers out yander in de
mash."</p>

<p>"Yu is too brash, sister," replied Joshua. "I
haint ergwine ter hab dem debbils spishunin dat
dar's a trap sot fo I gits hit sot. When de moon
gits back yander hind de trees hit will be sot, und
I aims fur yu ter pull de trigger."</p>

<p>"Oh, my king!" blurted out Clarissa, as she
wrung her hands, "und sposin hit don't go off ur
nuffin; den whot? Dis heer po nigger wud immytate

way ole Mars Jon got his def wound. Ef dat
ar trap is sot its bleeged ter be upsot by sumbody
dat's got mo ambishun agen his kuller dan I is,
yu heers my racket!" exclaimed Clarissa in great
excitement.</p>

<p>Joshua was the first to interview the dead bandits.
I can see him squatted upon his haunches
with palsied finger pointed at the fishy eyes exclaiming;</p>

<p>"Dar now square Wiggins jess see what yu is
fotched up agen at las. I dun und tole yu so; now
haint yu dun und dun it er trying to skeer ole

lak yu play biggerty dat de good Lord didn't slam

Lord is gwine to git de under holt ebery time."
And all the time Aleck lay with great lack-lustre
eyes staring and grinning at Joshua. "Und yu is
down dare too Efrum wid dem yaller upperlips,
pine plank lak de sun flowers in de jam of Hanna's
gyarden er bobbin up und down same as a

drounded nigger fore de bellion fell in all my born
days, and now yer kaint fro yer hook in de crick
fur a catfish yer aint skeered yu mout git tangled
up wid a drounded nigger."</p>

<p>Joshua paused to wipe the perspiration from his
face with his ragged coat sleeve, and the great
black crowd moved as by a common impulse to the
brink of the stream and gazed with a contrariety of
emotions upon the drowned negroes. The goggle
eyed coroner with his beaver in his hand stepped
a little to the front and commanded attention.</p>

<p>"Breddin," he said, "dars a time to live und dars a
time to die, und ef I must spaciate upon def befo
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
dis conjugation I mout say dat he cums in a
heap aways und a heap er fashuns; den agin he
cums when he hedn't ought ter cum. He cum dis
time when he hedn't ought ter cum und he hes
flung de hole goverment out of jint."</p>

<p>"Und I specks de boss will be bleeged ter mak
a signment ob de assets of North Caliny. Fur
de lans sake," exclaimed Joshua, "let me git wun
moufful ef she's agwine to bust." Without noting
the interruption, however, the coroner proceeded:</p>

<p>"I'm agwine ter ax brudder Skyles de slidin elder
to lead us all in prayer, und ter bless de Lord
dat de crowner und jurer is rite heer to sympathize
with our bereaved friends in the bonds of iniquity."</p>

<p>Aleck and his ill fated friends were still sea-sawing
in the water and after the prayer the man with
the hand organ and the monkey began to play in
squeaky, stridulous tones "The girl I left behind
me."</p>

<p>Joshua the octogenarian, was among the men
who were chosen upon the jury.</p>

<p>"Now den what is yer gemman gwine ter side erbout
dese drounded corpses?" asked the coroner.
There was a long painful pause when a very venerable
negro confronted the coroner with this enquiry;</p>

<p>"I rises to a question ob pribilige sar. I wishes
to quire, ef a crowbar mout be er witniss in his
own beharf, sar?"</p>

<p>"Sartanly sar, sartanly," answered the coroner:</p>

<p>"How is yer agwine to swar hit?" he continued.</p>

<p>"Now yer oversizes my siggassity sar; yer axes
pine blank" said the coroner, raising his spectacles
with great dignity, "'How dis jurer is agwine to
swar a crowbar;' is dat hit?"</p>

<p>"Yas sar," replied the negro.</p>

<p>"What sez yer gemman ob de jurer to dis qustun,"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
asked the coroner. After laying their heads
together, a juror pompously observed.</p>

<p>"Dat he hed seed a horg crost questuned in de
kote, und he convicted de prisner."</p>

<p>"Were he a white man?" the jury asked.</p>

<p>"No sar, dat time de prisoner was a cullud gemman
sar."</p>

<p>"Aye, Aye," they exclaimed in chorus.</p>

<p>"Und de nex time I seed a pare of galluses convict
a prisner."</p>

<p>"Was he a cullud gemman?" again they asked.</p>

<p>"No sar, he were a po white man."</p>

<p>"Jess so, Jess so," they again exclaimed with
infinite satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Fetch dat crowbar in heer und tell where yer
git him," said the coroner.</p>

<p>"I scovered him under de bridge," the negro answered.</p>

<p>"Whose name is dat, sar?' the coroner asked
pointing to the letters J. W. S. chiseled into the
iron handle.</p>

<p>"Haint dat Semo's name?" he again asked.</p>

<p>"It ar" answered a juror.</p>

<p>"Constable," the coroner stormed with wrath,
"Yer fech dat white man fo me, ded er live, und
summuns de possy common ta ters to go wid yer
sar. Und bredden," he continued, "we'll pass de
jimmyjon und tak a swipe while wee's erwaiting
fur de prisner."</p>

<p>Clarissa looked out of the kitchen window and
descried the negro constable and his posse advancing
rapidly toward the mansion. With her hands
just out of the kneaded flour she ran frantically to
her young mistriss with the exclamation,</p>

<p>"Lord have mercy, Miss Alice, yander cums ole
Shermans army; de plantashun is black und blu
wid niggers wid der muskits," "Oh, my Lord have
mussy on us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>Alice though greatly alarmed, replied as calmly
as possible,</p>

<p>"Dont you know Clarissa, we have never harmed
these people. Do you think they will kill us in
cold blood. Where is father? Come father, come
Clarissa, we will go into the verandah and meet
them, kindly face to face. Come, father, I know
you are brave&mdash;and you are a Christian. If they
have come to murder us&mdash;there is but a pang and
all will be over. In a moment we shall forget our
griefs, our humiliations. Let us clasp hands and
die altogether."</p>

<p>The negro constable observing the distress of
the family and wishing for the time being to avoid
excitement, halted his gang at the gate and advanced
to the old man with his warrant.</p>

<p>"Mr. Semo," said he, "Yer is scused of ferociously
homisiden de corpses in de crick und I'm
sent to fetch yer to de crowner."</p>

<p>"All right I will accompany you," the old man
said with resignation.</p>

<p>Poor Alice clung to her father's neck crying as if
her heart would break, and spoke pleadingly to the
negro.</p>

<p>"May I not go with my father? May I not die
with him? Oh, my dear, dear father. I cannot
bear the separation, the suspense. Please, please
Mr. Constable let my father remain here and let me
suffer and die for him."</p>

<p>"Oh my daughter, my child," petulantly cried
the old man, "this will not do." "Dry your tears
my dear child and be assured that the coroner cannot
do me harm. If he shall find me guilty, I
shall remain in jail only to-morrow. The court
convenes on Monday next when I shall be discharged
and return home. Give me a kiss now, and remember
dear, that your father is safe: Good-bye,
God bless you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>As Joshua, a juror, saw the feeble old man with
great effort advancing with the negro posse, he began
to shed tears and covered his furrowed face
with his old beaver:</p>

<p>"Po Mars Jon," he sobbed audibly, "Has it
cum to dis, scusing the bestest man in de
kentry wid foroshus homosiden. Marser, yu shall
hab jestice. I'll stan twix yer und def. Yu
know'd nuffin about dis massacre, jess ez innerson
ob dis scusation ez a baby&mdash;ebery bit und grane."</p>

<p>"Constable," asked the coroner, "fetch me dat
crowbar und de prisner." "Now den, dis heer
crowbar is a witnis agin yer, Mr. Semo, what has
yer got to say agin dis scusation sar?"</p>

<p>The Colonel replied with dignity, "I have not
seen it before in twelve months, I am sure."</p>

<p>"How cum dis heer crowbar under de bridge,
how cum de bridge fell down und how cum dem
fokses drounded, answer me dat?" sharply answered
the coroner.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell sir, I know nothing whatever
about the matter, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Boss Crowner," interrupted Joshua, "does yer
sposing dat ar crowbar was de cashun ob dat dar
drounen? Answer me dat fust. I aint agwine ter
sot on no man dat aint gilty. Diss heer bisniss is
ticklish bisniss, I tell yer dat rite now, und we is

marser Jon loose, und I call for de wote rite now."</p>

<p>This speech of the old negro seemed, as it were,
the gift of an oracle. It grappled with a great
subject of principle. Joshua was indeed an immune,
having nothing to fear from the negroes,
on account of his extreme old age and enjoying
the trust of the Colonel and his daughter.</p>

<p>He looked up at the flag as he concluded, as it
seemed to him just now to be overcast with the
murky vapors of oppression, and pointing his
bony finger toward its scarlet-veined folds, exclaimed
with the pathos, the spirit of an orator of
nature,</p>

<p>"De grate Lawd forbid dat yore stripes, 'Ole
Glory,' shall be washed in de blood ob my ole marser.
I welcomed yu in de Souf when I seed yu

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>Suffice it to say that in the opinion of the jury
John W. Seymour had committed the murder alleged
in the warrant and was committed to the
common jail for the unbailable capital crime.</p>

<h3>"A DANIEL COME TO JUDGMENT."</h3>


<p>The Reconstruction period in the South was offensively
institutional. There was a fascination
about the spoils principle, the "cohesive power of
public plunder" that allured all conditions of men
who put themselves in juxtaposition to the new order
of things. There was not a negro who valued
his manhood suffrage that did not yield implicit
faith and obedience to all that was told him by the
carpet-baggers, who came south as the "waves come
when navies are stranded." The elective judiciary
too was no mean accessory in the wholesale plunder
of the people; in the sale, delay and denial
of justice. The presence of the judge in the county
town to hold the court was, an event that was commonly
distinguished by farcical displays; exhibitions
as it were of harlequins, bazaars, organ-grinders
and negroes. From the four quarters of
the county exhausted mules and oxen were brought
into requisition and hitched to primitive vehicles;
negroes who were the worthless heads of pauper
families, astride the bare backs of horned cattle,
arriving in the town before the break of day and
thronging the public buildings, thoroughfares and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
court house. The leaders among the negroes would
call upon the judge in his chamber with a disgusting
obsequiousness that marked the depravity of
their origin. Punishments at times were the refinement
of oppression and as often a mockery of
the law. Partisan judgments were not unusual or
surprising.</p>

<p>An untried judge had come to hold the assizes;
he had come without the blast of a trumpet,
but the compact assemblage awaited with every
demonstration of joy his presence upon the bench.
The judge was a young man, seemingly of great
intellectual reserve, possessing a steel gray eye that
shot its glances through the subject as if it were
but marking a point through which his judgment
of a man would enter. There were courage, self
poise, wisdom, integrity apparent in the man who
had arrived to administer the law. For the first
time this judicial officer saw before him an indistinguishable
mass of the freedmen of the south.
He knew by intuition that they were ignorant, vicious
and corruptible; he saw that the prosecuting
attorney was a negro, the deputies of the sheriff
were negroes, the foreman of the grand jury was a
negro and doubtless he addressed to himself this
interrogatory in the law latin <i>cui bono</i>?</p>

<p>"There were indictments almost without number
for frauds, embezzlements and forgeries; the travail
of reconstruction."</p>

<p>Laflin had been perniciously active all the morning.
Before the judge had taken his seat upon
the bench, he had interviewed many of the men
who had been summoned upon the venire to try a
veteran of the lost cause for murder and their pockets
were filled with small bribes. He had checked
off twelve names and given the list to the solicitor
with the heartless remark "Now we'll hang the
old secesh higher than Haman, and you and I Mr.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
Solicitor will divide between us his homestead."
At this point of time an interruption came from
one of the negro jurors to this effect, "Boss dere's
wun secesh nigger dat sez he's agwine to hang de
jurer epseps yu gin him wun mo dollar."</p>

<p>"Blast the wretch!" came the curse of this man
of baleful power, "Where is he?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"See dat man standin dere ergin dat postess,
dats him."</p>

<p>"Here you fellow," said Laflin, "How much
money have you been paid to find the old secesh
guilty?"</p>

<p>The negro in an abstracted way felt in his pockets
and told the wretch that one juror had been
paid two dollars, while he had received only one
dollar, "und he mout conwic de rong man, den yu
see boss, de pay mout not be ekal to de sponuality.
Fling in wun mo dollar und de jurer gwine
to hang dat secesh sho."</p>

<p>This conclave of diabolical spirits was held in
the office of the sheriff at the hour of 9 a. m. Back
yonder in the common jail, behind the fretted bars,
was the veteran in the cell with black felons.</p>

<p>Why should the catalogue of this poor man's
misfortune be enlarged, by super-adding to the
loss of domestic tranquility, that greatest of all
calamities, the loss of his liberty, aggravated by
the imputation of crime and its consequent ignominy.
He feels that the storm without is fraught with
lightning, that renders desolate the face of nature,
his mind has lost its elasticity, its spring, its
pride; and who is the prisoner, whom the black
crowd follow with the gaping vacuity of vulgar ignorance,
assaulting him now and again with obscene
gibes, as he is led from the cell to the dock? He
is gifted by the God of nature with rare endowments,
whose unconquered spirit breaks forth in a
sentiment such as this,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Let the hangman lead these miscreants to the gibbet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let the ravens of the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fatten upon their flesh until they pick each tainted carcass from the bones."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There were indictments also for capital felonies,
and in the dock sat three hardened black criminals,
and one aged white man of distinguished presence,
who was whispering now and then to a beautiful
maiden in tears, a maiden so radiant in personal
attractions that she might have sat approvingly for
the portrait of Beatrice Cenci that looks down upon
the upturned faces in the Art Gallery in Florence.
He was a veteran of the civil war; a hero at
Malvern Hill; colonel commanding the regiment of
cavalry that by an extra hazardous maneuver
drove a Federal brigade into the death trap. By
his side sat as his attorney a white-haired gentleman,
who like a stately man of war, just going out
of commission, was sighting his guns upon the
enemy for the last time. This spectacle was so
full of the pathos of human life that it deserves
to be perpetuated in the memory, after the dry rot
shall have utterly honey-combed the odious system
of reconstruction. The arraignment of the
prisoner was proceeded with; the negro solicitor
presuming upon the hearty co-operation of the
judge ventilated his spleen upon the unfortunate
prisoner.</p>

<p>"Stand up, prisoner at the bar," he commanded
as he fairly spat his venom like a jungle serpent into
the face of the poor man. "Are you guilty or not
guilty of the felony and murder with which you
stand charged?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Not Guilty," answered the prisoner with a quiet
dignity.</p>

<p>"By whom will you be tried," the officer inquired
wrathfully.</p>

<p>"By God and my country," was the answer of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
this veteran of a hundred battles; this wise counsellor
of the law.</p>

<p>Were the twelve black jurors in the box his
country? had they ever given direction to his impulses
as a patriot? had they ever nerved his arm
to strike down the foe, that scourged his home into
barrenness and peopled the city of the dead
with his kindred? Had they like Joshua and Hur
ever stayed the hand of the prisoner, when with
drawn sword he guarded the portal of the temple?
Great God! Shall these human chattels, without a
single intellectual resource, without one ray of
discernment, besotted and bedraggled by fanaticism,
superstition and ignorance bring to this poor
man in this extremity a safe deliverance? In conducting
the prosecution, in the examination of the
witnesses the same brutish treatment was observed
by the solicitor for the state toward the aged prisoner,
and with an offensive parade of authority he
announced that the state had closed its case; thereupon
the white-haired Governor arose to ask for
the discharge of the prisoner for want of sufficient
evidence to convict. Now came the first interruption
upon the part of the judge, who up to this
moment had observed a reticence quite noteworthy
in a high judicial officer who was holding his first
court where the negroes ruled.</p>

<p>"It is unnecessary Governor that I should hear
you," he remarked with evident self-poise.</p>

<p>Turning to the solicitor he asked with deliberation,</p>

<p>"Can you tell me how the indictment against
this old man found its way into this court?"</p>

<p>"I can, sir," the solicitor impudently replied,
"and I propose," he exclaimed vehemently, "to
make good the charge by convicting this assassin
before this conscientious jury."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, indeed!" rejoined the judge quite complacently.
"Are you quite sure of your premises?"</p>

<p>"Yes indeed!" replied the solicitor.</p>

<p>"Take your seat, sir," the judge commanded,
with a frown upon his intelligent face. "I am informed,"
said he, addressing the negro solicitor,
"that you have been perniciously active in the persecution
of this feeble old man; that you have
gone out of your way to harass and humiliate
him in all possible situations; that you have advised
and encouraged and rewarded placable agents
and emissaries to render his life burdensome and
his condition intolerable; that you have caused inquisitorial
visits to be made to his home by ruffianly
negroes in the dead hours of the night; that
you have conspired and confederated with a loathsome
being&mdash;a man, however, of controlling influence
with the negroes&mdash;by the name of Laflin, to
inflict upon him and his daughter every indignity
your evil imagination could suggest; that acting
under your devilish advice and inventions, lawless,
brutish negroes have set at defiance every dictate
of humanity, every precept of religion, and
every commandment of the law, and have turned
his home into a hell; that when a superficial examination
into this case would have shown you that
this negro, whom you say was murdered by this
unfortunate prisoner gathered around him a bestial
mob of the most despicable, offensive negroes,
armed with guns and swords to take his life by
force of insurrectionary combinations, you dare to
clutch the ermine of this court with your defiled
fingers! You have disgraced the position you occupy;
your right to prosecute the criminal docket in
this court is suspended. You will take your seat
in the prisoner's dock until I can have you tried
and sentenced to the penitentiary. This man is in
your custody, Mr. Sheriff. Mr. Clerk, you will at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
once issue a bench warrant for the arrest of Abram
Laflin and the coroner, Jackson Thorp, and have
them brought before me at once. Colonel Seymour,"
he continued, addressing the prisoner,
and at the same time extending his hand, "you
have my sympathy. I have observed with pain and
indignation the alarming condition of affairs in
your county. I am sitting upon this bench as a
judge to discharge my duty in the fear of God.
You are fully vindicated, sir, and may retire when
you please."</p>

<p>A stampede of negroes who had thronged the
court room swept away every obstruction, and
within one hour after the arrest of the carpet-bagger
and the coroner, mules, oxen, negroes, dogs and
organs and monkeys were in precipitate flight
through the town.</p>

<p>"Grate Jerusalem!" exclaimed an old negro who
had fallen down the stairway in his flight, "de
debbil has sho broke loose in dis hear town. Dat
ar jedge is wusser dan a harrykane."</p>

<p>The scene that followed was intensely dramatic.
Men who had never been demonstrative before, at
the hour of recess, thronged the judge to thank
him for his honesty and courage in this hour of
trial. The Governor, Colonel Seymour and his
beautiful daughter awaited the presence of the
judge in the parlor of the public inn, and as the
learned man entered the room greatly embarrassed,
Alice thought he was the manliest man she ever
saw&mdash;faultlessly handsome, with the poise of a
patrician. The judge took her extended hand, and
blushing deeply, looked down into the lustrous
blue eyes that were laughing through tears and
said, almost audibly, to himself, "Is it possible
that this beauty will ever fade?" Could we introspect
the great man's heart, we should find even
then a little weaver picking up here and there
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
golden threads and cris-crossing them into entangling
meshes; and perhaps a little archer was drawing
back his bow to transfix two hearts and hold
them up before him while he laughed and laughed
again at his conquest.</p>

<p>"Miss Seymour," the judge exclaimed, quite
compassionately, "I regret that your father has
been so greatly outraged. I hope he will soon forget
it and that his life will be happy. I am grateful
to you for the pleasure of this visit. May I
hope to see you at your home in the country?"</p>

<p>Alice replied, both weeping and smiling, that
she could never repay the debt of gratitude.</p>

<p>"I feel that there is not now a cloud upon my
little horizon&mdash;that your considerate judgment has
dispelled the shadows that veiled in my life, and I
shall live now for my father and his happiness."</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear miss!" replied the judge, somewhat
confused, "do not thank me for doing my
duty. You don't know how my heart yearned towards
your helpless father in the hands of these
barbarians." And all the while the little archer,
now an imprisoned eaves-dropper, was peeping out
of the curtains with his chubby hand to his tiny
ear and whispering, "Love at first sight."</p>

<p>Joshua was a unit in this compact mass of freedmen
that squatted here and there upon rude benches
and crowded the aisles in that great auditorium of
negroes. There were snow-white dishevelled locks
under primitive hats and bonnets; there were hollow
cheeks and lack lustre eyes; there were hungry
stomachs, limbs palsied and stiffened here in the
very May day of reconstruction. The commissariat
with its great reservoirs of fatness was ever
so far away, and its approaches were guarded by
armed freedmen who like bearded pards demanded
money. "Old Glory" too, hung inert from the flag
staff, blushing perhaps because the judge is sitting
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
upon the bench to despatch business; because a
Daniel has come to judge Laflin and to give him
his pound of flesh without blood. As the colonel
was assisting his daughter into the buggy, after the
tumult was over, Joshua ambled up to him with
his battered beaver in his hand with fulsome congratulations.</p>

<p>"I knowed all de time ole marser dat yu was
agwine to get clar. I seed it in dat jedge's eyes
when he heered dat ditement red. He got wexed
dat ar minit, und shuck his hed und I knowed den
dat de state had flung de fat in de farr, und I said
to mysef, Joshaway, yu und ole marser is agwine
home wid wun anuder dis werry nite und it cum
out lak I spishuned."</p>

<p>"Uncle Joshua," interrupted Alice feelingly,
"father and I are very grateful for your kindness
and you shall never suffer as long as we live. Here
is a dollar; buy Aunt Hannah what she needs,
remember, you must not buy whiskey with it."</p>

<p>"Tank yu yung missis, tank yu a fousand times.
I am gwine to lay dis out for Hannah. I aint
agwine to tech narry cent of it, und when dat
nigger sees me coming home with all my bundles
she is agwine to jump clean clar outen her
skin. I don't care ef I nebber sees dat kommissary
no mo," and in the transport of joy the old
negro tossed his old beaver high into the air while
he lustily cried out, "free cheers for Miss Alice
und ole marser."</p>

<p>There were many things that pre-occupied the
minds of Alice and her father as they were driving
home. The old man in a sentimental spirit felt
like exclaiming with the sacred writer "These, and
such as these are spots in our feasts of charity;
clouds they are without water, trees whose fruit
withereth; raging waves of the sea foaming out
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
their own shame; wandering stars to whom is reserved
the blackness of darkness forever."</p>

<p>As they neared the old homestead, Clarissa was
standing in the gateway, jumping up and down
automatically with arms tossing like the fans of a
Dutch windmill, shouting frantically, "glory, glory,
the dead has cum to life agin, blessed Lord de insurreckshun
has done und riz agen. Jurusulum
my happy home" and she threw her arms around
her young mistress and in the excess of feeling
hugged even the old hound. "Come in to de kitchen
ole marser und Miss Alice fur de lans sake und see
what a snipshus dinner I has got, barbecue, taters
and chicken and homily und sich lak."</p>

<p>Joshua stood in the road to watch his ole marser
fast disappearing in the distance; then taking the
crisp note from the lining of his old hat, brandished
it aloft as if it were 'old glory.' It was the first
currency of the kind he had ever seen, for the
coroner had refused to pay his per diem as a juror
at the inquest, averring as an excuse therefor dat
dat wote was agin de consecushon und hit jam nigh
spiled de hole werdict. Joshua steadied himself
against an empty whisky barrel and began to calculate
as to the purchasing capacity of the dollar
note.</p>

<p>"Now lem me count on de tip eend of the fingers
scusing de fumb dat don't count," said he. "Hanner
she wants a kote und a par of brogans, allus awanting
mo dan de munny is agwine to fetch," he observed
parenthetically, "und den dare is me, bleeged
to have a weskote und gallusses, und dat will take
every bit und grane; und how is I agwine to git
eny bakker, und I'm bleeged to have a drap of sperrits.
Now lem me count over gin und git dis ole
fumb outen de way; de kote is fifty cents und de
shoes is seventy five cents, dat won't do," he said as
he scratched his head, "I'm gwine to leabe off de
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
kote; den dere is de shoes seventy-five cents, und
de weskote seventy-five cents; dat won't do nudder.
I'm agwine to leabe off de shoes; den dare is de
gallusses twenty-five cents, und de weskote seventy-five
cents; den whar is de bakker? I'm agwine to lebe
off de weskote; den dare is de gallusses twenty-five
cents, und de bakker twenty-five cents, und de sperrits
fifty cents; de munny haint ergwine to hole out
no udder way I can fix it; now den de sperrits
fust, und de bakker nex und gallusses las," and
when the old negro had solved the problem he
struck a bee line to the nearest groggery, saying
to himself, "Ef Miss Alice had axed me not to buy
no sperrits I'd a been kotched pine plank."</p>

<p>"Two years in the penitentiary," Joshua heard
some one exclaim as he was passing the court
house.</p>

<p>"Who dat boss gwine to de penitenshur?" he
stopped to enquire.</p>

<p>"Abram Laflin," came the answer.</p>

<p>"Don't you heer dat!" exclaimed Joshua, "Fredum
is sho gin out now. Ellic dun und gon und
got hissef drounded, und on de tip eend of dat de
boss is dun und got hissef in de penitenshur. Land
sakes alive! Niggers got to walk perpendickkler
now," and with that the old negro dodged into the
tippling shop.</p>

<p>"Say boss?" Joshua said to the rum-seller, "Fill
me a tickler rite full er rum; don't put narry
drap of whiskey in hit, kase ef yu dus my creddick
is dun und gon fur ebber. Now what dus I have
to pay?" he asked as he put the bottle into his
haversack.</p>

<p>"Seventy-five cents," sharply answered the salesman.</p>

<p>"My King!" ejaculated Joshua, "Den what is I
gwine to do about dem gallusses?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come old negro," the clerk crustily replied,
"get out and let that man come to the counter."</p>

<p>As Joshua was moving suspiciously out of the
dram shop he glanced savagely at the man and said
to himself, "Dis heer low down white trash is a
gwine to be de ruinashun ob dis kentry yit, agougging
de werry eyeballs out ob yer hed, und yu are
standin rite dare urseein dem do hit. I wishes
dat dar jedge wud git holt ob dese speretual shops
und squashes dem lak he dun dat ditement agin ole
marser."</p>

<p>In the small hours of the night Joshua stumbled
against the door of his cabin crying like a lunatic.</p>

<p>"Fer de lan sake Hanner, run out here und kill
dese heer snakes, und fetch my muskit along wid
yu."</p>

<p>And Hannah in her night robes ran out frantically
crying, "Show me dem dar sarpents, whar is
dey Joshaway?"</p>

<p>"Dar dey go," said he, and seizing the musket
he banged away at the earth exclaiming, "Ef yu is
sho naff snakes yu is in a bad fix und ef yu aint
sho nuff snakes den I's in a wusser wun."</p>

<p>"Yu stracted fool," angrily shouted Hannah,
"Yu is got de lerium tremenjous, dat's what ails

<h3>AN UNSEEN HAND UPON THE LEVER.</h3>


<p>The old master at Ingleside had been so greatly
exasperated by intrusive visitors that Clarissa, who
was now acting in the dual character of man and
maid, had received express orders to admit no one
into the mansion who could not give a good account
of himself or herself; so when Judge Livingstone
rang the door-bell, Clarissa who was sweeping
the dust from the hall dropped the broom with
the tart observation,</p>

<p>"I specks dat is ernudder dratted scalyhorg cum
to tantylize ole mars Jon," and she crept dubiously
to the door to peep, and perceiving that there
was a white man in the verandah without a gun or
other weapon of offensive war, she halloed loudly
through the keyhole.</p>

<p>"Whos yu?" To which no answer was returned.</p>

<p>"Don't yu heer me axes yu whos yu? If yu
don't answer white man I'm agwine to sick ole
Jube on yu, und run yu outen dis plantashun.
Whos yu I sez?" repeated the old negro.</p>

<p>"My name is Mr. Livingtone, a friend of your

<p>"I kaint heer nary wurd yu sez, fur ole Jube."
"Git outen de way dorg wid your whinin. You

<p>"I am Judge Liv&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, my Lord," interrupted Clarissa with a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
scream, and she ran back like a maniac wringing
her hands and shouting,</p>

<p>"Oh, my po yung missis, de man has dun und
cum to preach de funral; de gallus is dun und uprared
in dis grate house, und de jedge hez dun und
cum to pull de trigger, und de werry fust one
he axes fur is yu. Good-bye, Miss Alice," she
exclaimed, as she frantically clutched her dress
and dropped upon her knees. "Und ef I nebber
sees yu no mo in dis wurell tak care of yerself und
meet me in de starry hellyments whar dar aint
gwine ter be no mo tribbylashun of sperets."</p>

<p>It was a full minute before Alice could calm her
agitation, as tears from an excess of conflicting
sensations ran down her cheeks. Regaining self-possession
she said with a show of authority, "You
must not act in this way Clarissa; what will the
gentleman think of us if we do not render a proper
excuse for your misconduct?"</p>

<p>"Miss Alice," said Clarissa, as she placed her
arms akimbo, "Ef yu had seed dat dar man's eyes
when he sed he was de jedge yu'd er run too, und
yu wudn't er stopt running twell yit. My King!
dem eyes was wusser dan shuting stors," she exclaimed,
as she wiped the great beads of sweat from
her face with her apron.</p>

<p>"You go to the door now, and very politely invite
the gentleman into the parlor, be very careful
Clarissa that you do not offend him."</p>

<p>As Clarissa, now reassured, was moving stealthily
toward the door, her mistress overheard her say
to herself,</p>

<p>"I aint agwine to fend him epcepts he fends me
fust, den I'm agwine ter run agin, und I aint ergwine
ter stop no mo twell I gits to de mashes."</p>

<p>Clarissa opened the door with a very polite bow,
as she addressed the stranger patronizingly.</p>

<p>"Misses sed how dat you mout come in, being
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
how dat it was yu. So cum erlong rite back of
me. Git outen de way Jube, er scrapin quaintance
wid dat stinguished white man, same as he was a
low down nigger; fust ting you knose yu be shut
up in de jail house widout ary moufful of wittles, er
howlin same as er wildcat."</p>

<p>It is proper just here to remark that Clarissa had
never been a correspondent or pupil of Lord Chesterfield.
She had been emancipated from the slavvish
drudgery of the corn-field, promoted as it
were from the cabin to the mansion. Her manners
were direct, pungent, self-assertive, and her gibberish
and volubility were immensely amusing to
the high official who was now adapting himself to
conditions and experiences as they prevailed in the
southland; and from time to time interrogating the
negro as he or she appeared without the superficialities
of reconstruction.</p>

<p>As Clarissa saw Judge Livingstone safely in the
parlor she went back to her mistress, and with emphasis
of speech and gesture told her what had
been said and done, and returned with the commands
of her mistress to the distinguished guest.</p>

<p>"You jes set rite whar yu is und mak yerself
homelike, dar aint no foolishness erbout our white
folks. Me und Miss Alice has been aworrying ourselves
jamby to def ober de smutty cook pots, und
she says how dat yu must scuse her," and she wiped
her black face again with her old apron. The
judge failing to comprehend the meaning of the
negro in the crude vernacular of the plantation,
a speech that under all circumstances with malice
prepense slew the idioms of the English language,
arose to retire, regretting as he said, "That he could
not see her young mistress;" when Clarissa with
great warmth expostulated.</p>

<p>"Hole on dar, Mars Jedge; Miss Alice is ergwine
ter cum jes ez soon ez she washes de smut offen her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
face und slicks back her eyebrows. My king! duz
yu speks er high quality lady lak my yung missis
kin do eberyting in wun minit? She haint ergwine
ter brake her neck kase a jedge cums heer a courtin
her. My missis seed jedges fore ter-day; yu aint
de onliest jedge she ever seed." And with this
confusing declamation Clarissa shuffled out of the
parlor with the parting remark, "Yu's stay rite
whar yu is twell she cums."</p>

<p>When the negro had gone the judge laughed immoderately.
Indeed, he was laughing with wide-open
mouth as Alice entered the parlor, and advanced
to grasp her hand, confused and stammering.</p>

<p>"Ah, permit me," he said, "er, er, er, to felicitate
myself that you have given me the pleasure
of this interview."</p>

<p>Alice felt a suspicion that the old negress had
been amusing the learned judge in her droll way,
but she did not know to what extent she had been
compromised by her oddities and ignorance, and
to quiet her apprehensions as far as she could, she
asked with seriousness:</p>

<p>"How long have you been in our county?"</p>

<p>"It is my first visit, and I have greatly enjoyed
it," replied the judge, with an effort to conceal his
mirth. "The South has been an object lesson of
great educational value to me."</p>

<p>"Ah! and who are your teachers?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"Why, who can they be but the negroes?" replied
the judge interrogatively.</p>

<p>"I am quite surprised!" exclaimed the young
lady.</p>

<p>"Not so much so as I have been, I am sure," the
judge replied. "I am a Northern man with a heart
firmly set against what I believed to be the vagaries
of Southern people: absorbing the sentiments
and convictions of my home folks; but since I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
have been in your country I have discovered that
the South has been outraged and scandalized beyond
the point of endurance. Do you know," he
continued argumentatively, "that I have never
seen among my most intimate friends truer or nobler
men, and I have never seen in the jails and
penitentiaries of the north a criminal class more
hardened and vicious than these wretches whom
you call carpet-baggers."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," replied Alice reflectively, "they
have given us a great deal of trouble, and we are
so glad that you have punished the infamous
wretch Laflin, who has incited the negroes to acts
of violence and bloodshed."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the judge, "I only regret that
the law interposed a limit to the measure of punishment.
I would have been glad to have sentenced
the villain for life to the penitentiary at hard
labor.</p>

<p>"By the way, Miss Seymour, the governor bade
me say to your father that he would join us
here to-day. Will you convey the message to him
at your leisure?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said the girl. "Pray excuse
me for a moment. My father will be delighted to
receive the information; the governor is an old and
dear friend."</p>

<p>The picture now presented to her distinguished
guest, a man of clear discernment, as Colonel Seymour,
leaning upon the arm of his lovely daughter&mdash;whose
beautiful face was aglow with health&mdash;painfully
walked into the parlor, was picturesque
and pathetic; indeed, it was the deepening twilight
and the blush of Aurora. Here were hard,
rigid lines, corded and seamed by age, and here
were the pencilings of the artist, whose handiwork
is seen as well in the exquisite tintings of the morning
iris. Here were palsied limbs, snow-white
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
hair, accentuated by intimate contact with marvellous
beauty and litheness of figure, that impressed
the intellectual, discriminating judge.</p>

<p>Advancing with extended hand, he met the old
man upon the threshold of the room with an affectionate
refinement of manner that bespoke the
thoroughness of the gentleman; the Colonel observing
to his guest, as the latter conducted him to
a chair, that the gout had made a cripple of him,
but that in all other respects he was quite himself.
It was all too evident to the far-sighted judge that
an unseen hand had its grasp upon the lever and
was running the home-stretch with accelerated momentum.</p>

<p>"Your coming," said the Colonel, "has been like
the bearing of a flag of truce; it has given us hope&mdash;life;
it has ungeared the harrow that crushed us
so remorselessly."</p>

<p>"I thank you, my dear sir," most gratefully
answered the judge with feeling. "I have endeavored
to discharge my duty, and how could I do
this, sir, in this country without using the scourge?
You have a fine country and a magnanimous people&mdash;a
people who love liberty and law&mdash;and it is
a personal affliction to witness in how many ways
you are insulted and oppressed."</p>

<p>At this juncture Clarissa knocked softly at the
door to announce to her mistress "dat de guberment
hez dun und riv," and Alice, excusing herself,
retired, concealing her laughter as much as
possible, which was provoked by the ludicrous deficiencies
of the corn-field negro. It was a metaphor
which the negro had ignorantly employed. The
Governor was not the government, or any part
thereof. Had he been, Ingleside would have been
safeguarded by a sentinel utterly impervious to
any sensation of fear, not so ignorant or cowardly
as Clarissa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>The arrival of the Governor was formally announced
by Alice and he was ushered into the
parlor, and Alice withdrew to give some directions
to Clarissa, whom she found sitting in her rickety
chair in the kitchen humming</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My ole Kentucky home, fur away."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Clarissa," the young lady asked as she approached
her, "what do you suppose the judge
thought of us this morning and of our maid of all
work?"</p>

<p>Clarissa looked up into the face of her young
mistress with a stare almost of vacuity, and after
a moment's reflection said, with her accustomed
pertness,</p>

<p>"I kaint hep dat, Miss Alice, ole marser dun und
gin me my orders, und I want agwine ter let nobody
pass nur repass ef I knoed it. Ole marser
he noes his bizness, und ef he tells me ter keep de
kyarpet-sackers outen dis grate house I'm ergwine
ter do it ef de good Lawd spares me. Don't fault
me, Miss Alice, wid ole marser's doins, fur de lan's
sake. How cum dat dar jedge outen here any how?
Dar aint no kote ergwine on in dis heer grate house
dat I noes of. Specks dar is ergwine ter be wun

ergwine ter git conwicted und sont clean erway

"Dat dar jedge is er portly man, but my
king! dem dar eyes, ugh-h-h! cuts froo yu same ez
er razor."</p>

<p>Alice laughed again and again at the old negro,
and after awhile coyishly remarked, "Never mind,
Clarissa, never mind."</p>

<p>Clarissa turned her old head to one side as she
replied with great earnestness.</p>

<p>"Taint wurf while to say neber mind Clarsy,
neber mind, I seed fo now what was agwine to be
de upshot of dis bisniss. I knowed pine plank
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>

rider und I hopes und prays dat yu may, kase
ef yu don't youse ergwine ter be er lone lorn orfin
creetur arter ole marser's hed dun und layed low."</p>

<p>The conversation of the distinguished gentleman
naturally drifted into channels that had been cut
very deep by the sharp edged tools of reconstruction;
the judge deferentially yielding to his seniors
who had witnessed the workmanship of unskilled
hands, and what he ventured to say from
time to time was in the way of suggestions or mild
expostulations.</p>

<p>The Governor when discussing reconstruction
was opinionated and emphatic. Every paragraph
was punctuated with a sneer, gesture or frown.</p>

<p>"Had the suggestions of president Lincoln prevailed,"
he began, "the South would have been God's
country; but wicked counsels predominated. There
was not a statute enacted by a legislature, nor an
order made by a general, nor a proclamation issued
by a governor, nor a requisition made by the head
of a department that did not whet the sword with
which they were prodding into the bowels of the
South, after the final capitulation. These atrocious
policies were conceptions of men who swore in
their wrath that not a blade of grass should spring
where their hellish coursers planted hoof; that in
the realigning of the federal union, strong black
lines should be drawn with a savage vengeance
over the face of the South. Reconstruction was
the act of self-destruction, and the suicides deserve
to be buried without the shedding of a tear,
without christian sepulture in outlawed graves. They
made the thorn to spring up where the fir-tree had
flourished, and the bramble instead of the myrtle
tree. In these abominable acts there is death;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
death enough to satisfy the grave. Before the ink
was dry upon the parchment, before the funereal
bake-meats were cold, they contract an unnatural
covenant of marriage with four million slaves, disbanded
outlaws from the army, and put upon them
the mask of freedom to conceal the horrid front of
tyranny. Sirs, we rebel against the outrage.
When the Philistines are upon us shall we not
rise and shake ourselves, or shall we lay our heads
in the lap of Delilah, to be shorn of our power; to
be bound in chains, until we shall pray God to
avenge our wrongs in the common destruction of
ourselves and our enemies. No sirs, they shall find
that when we are prostrated, that like Antæus we
shall rise with renewed vigor from our shame.
Why this glozing title "Reconstruction?" Who
shall declare its generation? What holy font was
polluted by its baptism? Whence its bastard origin?
Plots, the vile brood of malice have been
hatched under fanatical incubation and piloted
southward, like flocks of harpies, that by their uncleanness
they might defile our civilization. Every
blight of calumny from ultra partisan&mdash;press and
pulpit, has been blown upon southern character.
Their speeches are filled with fields scourged down
to barrenness, and negroes multiplied and worked
up to the very tragedy of indiscriminate assassinations.
We will not propitiate the black devils by
heaping their altars with sacrifices; black fiends
who, like the great dragon in the Apocalypse, are
sweeping after them into the abysm, filled with
slaughter, one third of the stars in our political
heaven. Which of these stars are to be fixed, or
which are to be planetary in this black firmament of
eternal night; which primary, and which central,
which wandering stars and which satellites, are
matters for their savage taste. For my state may
God in his infinite mercy decree that the laws of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
position and movement may be ascertained and established,
before it, once so beautiful and bright,
shall go down and down forever below a horizon of
blood. They may like wrestlers in the arena
bring us to our knees, but never sir, shall they lay
us on our backs. Let us alone, and the dews and
the rains and the sunshine of heaven, (the only
creatures of God left by them in friendship with
us) shall give to our blood-stained fields moisture
and fertility, and time and labor and God's blessing
shall cover the land with verdure, with cottonfields
and gardens, pastures and meadows. They
promised us peace, and it came with the mutterings
of a tornado. In our vain efforts to compromise
the situation we turned our backs upon the
past, hallowed as were its memories. We had
ceased to remember the execrations of fanatics,
even the 'league with the devil, and the covenant
with hell.'</p>

<p>"We did all this and more, after we had passed
fire-scathed through an ordeal whose voice was
storm and whose movement was earthquake, which
swept from us every visible substance; so that in
our last and extremest agony we were forced to
cry aloud, like Francis at Pavia, "All is lost save
honor." We gave the government our parole; we
hammered our swords into plow-shares and pruning-hooks;
we pitched our tents upon the fire-blasted
lands where once had been our homes, and
with axe and mattock and blade and plow began
to cut away brambles and bushes and cultivate
our fields; and when we believed that we were secure
in the enjoyment of our rights of persons and
property, the authors of reconstruction swept down
upon the beleaguered South like Hyder Ali upon
the Carnatic, and left scarcely a vestige upon which
to hope, or from which to rebuild, except our worn-out
lands and our own splendid manhood and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
womanhood. States were despoiled of their resources,
towns and cities were battered and burned;
the angel of death had crossed every threshhold,
and three hundred thousand of the flower
and chivalry of the land were lying in soldiers'
graves. Our public institutions were languishing
unto death; from centre to circumference there
were outlawries, assassinations, conflagrations; and
our people looked into the faces of each other
and in their helplessness asked what other calamities
are reserved for us and our children. They
seized upon four million slaves and hurled them
like immense projectiles against our civilization.
And to conclude, sir, for I find I am getting excited,
in this catastrophe our hopes were stayed upon the
honest men of the North, like you, sir, and our
noble, patriotic women, like you, my dear miss,"
bowing with boyish gallantry to Alice. "The
women of the sixties are more than heroines in
the storm-swept crisis&mdash;they are a revelation in the
flesh. What Arria was to Pætus, what Natalia
was to Adrian, what Gertrude was to Rudolph,
what Helen, the Jennie Dean of the 'Heart of Midlothian,'
was to Tibbie, what Prascovia was to the
Russian exile, our self-sacrificing women are to us.
There has never been an occasion when the habit
of instantaneous obedience to the voice of love and
country has produced more affecting and constant
instances of devotion and loyalty upon the part of
the women, than in the gleaning of the aftermath
by hands saturated with all the crimes of the calendar.</p>

<p>"And now, gentlemen," (the Governor bowed), "if
I have given offence by any intemperate expression,
will you please forgive me, for my wrath
waxes warm when concentrated upon the subject
of reconstruction. Perhaps, sir," he continued,
addressing His Honor, "you are not in sympathy
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
with the views I may have inconsiderately expressed?"</p>

<p>"Why, my dear sir," the judge replied, "I have
never been in sympathy with a policy which you
have so eloquently denounced, and which the patriotic
people of the North sincerely deprecate, and
I quite agree with you that reconstruction has unlocked
a Pandora box of evils whose fledgelings
are hovering over this land."</p>

<p>The sun was now setting with an iridescent aureole
of gold and carmine and purple as the judge
remarked apologetically, "I have been struggling
with myself between inclination and duty; indeed
I find it embarrassingly difficult to tear myself
from so charming a circle. I have only a few
minutes to catch the train, and you don't know
how much I grieve to say good-bye. I shall be in
your town again within the next month, and may
I indulge the hope that I shall be once more welcomed
at Ingleside?"</p>

<p>"We shall only be too glad to be similarly honored,"
replied Colonel Seymour with deference.</p>

<p>Clarissa, who was standing near the door with her
arms folded and grinning like a blackamoor, gave
the judge the parting bow, as he placed into her
hand a dollar note, and putting her apron to her
face, so she might whisper the better, with a negroish
curtsy, said,</p>

<p>"Yu mus sho cum ergin mars jedge, our fokses
laks yu mazing, und I'm ergwine ter tell yu de
nex time what Miss Alice dun und sed erbout yu;
I knose dats ergwine ter fotch yu back."</p>

<p>The Governor remained at Ingleside throughout
the night and like a gladiator in the arena was
fighting, with the broad sword of invective, a duel
in dialectics with the parliamentarians of reconstruction;
the Colonel the meanwhile reinforcing
the athlete as a reserve. Alice at a late hour retired
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
with her head filled with fantastic notions,
and Clarissa too stretched her aching bones upon
her bed wondering in her pragmatic way, "Ef dat
shiny eyed judge was agwine ter hold his sho nuff
kote in de grate house, und ef she was agwine ter
be de juror und Miss Alice de konwick."</p>

<p>Old Joshua like an overripe sheaf of barley was
now to lay his head in the dust. The swift horses
were harnessed and cantering toward his door.</p>

<p>"Son of man behold I take away from thee the
desire of thine eyes with a stroke, yet neither
shalt thou mourn, neither shalt thy tears run
down." Four score and two years were the days of
the years of his pilgrimage; many and evil had the
days of his years been. Would there be mourners
at the burial? Will 'old glory' hang its head again
as it did at the assizes, when an outraged commonwealth
was proceeding to judgment against Laflin
for enumerated transgressions? Three score and ten
years are the complement of life, within which the
balance sheet is prepared; repenting against sinning;
undoing against doing; dying against living;
accounts and contra-accounts, all fairly computed,
and the quotient announced by Him who breathes
into man's nostrils the breath of life. Four score
and two years! What changes in the theories and
forms of governments; what contrarieties in the
pursuits and ambitions of man. The messenger
came without the rattling of wheels, without
knocking at the door, came on unsandaled
feet.</p>

<p>"Hannah, I'm agwine home, good-bye," was the
hurried parting, as the messenger thrust him into
his chariot. Side by side he sat with the voiceless
ambassador, while the stars were twinkling in the
midnight sky; a fast disappearing type of the picturesque
civilization of the sixties. His tracks
around the old commissariat are now faded into
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
nothingness, and old glory will wave on and on
"froo de trees," just as proudly as that day when
he stood at its staff and patriotically saluted the
stars and stripes with uncovered head, proclaiming
his loyalty in the grateful expression, "I node
when I seed yu a sea-sawing in de air dat dar was
a stummick full of good wittles some whays."</p>

<p>In the true representative outlines of the old
South there is a number dropped from the rolls,
that is all. In its new birth of constitutional liberty,
postponed until patriots shall have tired of
a government inefficient and venal, the memory of
Joshua, laden with fragrance, will cling to hearts
that now deplore his death. Good bye, Uncle
Joshua until we meet upon the golden strand! Until
we see you again without your staff, with your
face radiant with a celestial gleam, in a fleecy robe,
with golden sandals; until we hear you say so contentedly,
"Brederin, dere is kommissaries all erroun
in dis butiful country, und yu kin buy widout
munny und widout price."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>

<h3>AN HOUR WITH DICKENS.</h3>


<p>Alice felt that she could see a new light come
into the window, into the old home, into her soul;
that a peace had come visibly into the shadowed
mansion, now that Aleck and Ephraim and the negro
constable were dead in the mud of the river;
now that the Federal head had been removed by
the battle-axe of the fearless judge. She began to
hope again, perhaps to love again, who shall say?
There was, it may be, a tiny sunbeam coquetting
with the old shadows that had so long overlaid
every approach to her young heart, and perhaps
a little be-jewelled goldsmith was tinkering and
hammering upon a tiny arrow pointed with a ruby,
and feathered with tiny pinions of some diminutive
bird, that nested among fragrant mangoes far
away in the isles of the sea, with which he was to
shoot down those unsightly idols that had long
pre-empted her heart. The days were loitering,
she thought, in their flight, and the little brownie
who had been counting the numerals of time in
their flight had fallen asleep, and the old clock in
the great hall ticked languidly as if it were tired
to death with its unvarying round of toil.</p>

<p>In this awakening to the brighter possibilities
whom should she clasp to her heart but her old
friend, Charles Dickens? The Dickens of Dombey,
of Bleakhouse, of David Copperfield. She
remembered how this marvellous story-teller, so
familiar to all young readers, who had so many
children of his own, the offspring of an overflowing
fancy, one bleak day had passed up and down
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
Westminster Hall, clasping to his heart the magazine
that contained his first effusions, with eyes
dimmed with pride and joy, as he dropped stealthily,
at twilight, a suspicious package into a dark
letter box down a dark alley. How many times
the narrative had woven golden filaments here and
there through the warp of reconstruction! What a
bright filagree into the shadows that were unceasingly
coming and going! How many happy hours
she had whiled away with Mr. Pickwick and his
admiring friends! How delightfully she had been
entertained by the wit of Samuel Weller, the eloquence
of Sergeant Buzfuz, of Captain Bunsby!
Many a hypochondriac had laughed immoderately
at the ludicrous exercises of Crummles and the infant
phenomenon! What a charming companion
is Dick Swiveller, the inimitable! Dear old Dick;
reeling now and then from excess of wine, but great
hearted withal. Who does not even now occasionally
inhale the fragrant odors of the delicious
punches compounded by that blighted being, Mr.
Wilkins Micawber, as he listens to Sairy Gamp
and laughs at Mrs. Harriss? Where is the tender-hearted
Christian who would shout for a policeman,
while they are ducking Shepherd, or pommelling
Squeers, or cudgelling Pecksniff, or inflicting
divers and deserved assaults upon Uriah Heep?
With what a motley crowd of living characters
Dickens has peopled our literature? What children
were ever like his children? What homes were
ever like their homes? There is little Pip and honest
old Joe Gargery, who pauses for a moment at
his anvil to observe with animation, "Which I
mean ter say, that if you come into my place bull
baiting and badgering me, come out! Which I
mean ter say, as sech, if yu're a man, come on!
which I mean to say that what I mean ter say, I
mean to say and stand or fall by;" and Mrs. Joe
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
over watchful and over masterful always, who in
the alembic of nature had discovered no better
way of bringing little Pip up than "by hand."
Then there is little Oliver Twist, a poor little waif,
always hungry, licking the platter and now and
then, embarrassingly asking "for more;" and poor
Smikes is more terribly tragic, for he lived longer;
and little Nell the heart child of unnumbered
thousands, tramping along the roads, footsore and
ever so weary, a poor little wanderer without home,
until the good Lord looks down into her tearful
eyes and says one day, "Little Nell your little
hands and your little feet and your little heart are
so tired, will you not come with me, child?" And
little Paul Dombey lying wearily in the trundle
bed, within sound of the manifold voices of the sea,
turns languidly to his sister Florence and asks
with the natural inquisitiveness of a child, "What
are the wild waves saying?" And Joe All Jones
moves almost heedlessly on to death through more
streets than those of London; and Tom Pinch,
Betsy Trotwood and faithful old Peggotty and
Ham, whose very oddities and deficiencies are turned
into a crown of glory; and the sneering melodramatic
villains and scape-graces, Monck and Quilp,
and the blind man in Barnaby Rudge, and the Jew
Fagan and Murdstone and Carker; and the high
spirited Steerforth and Nickleby and Creakle, and
Stiggins and Chadband and Sampson Brass and
Snawley; and poor little idiotic Barnaby, as on the
way to the gallows he points to the stars, and says
to Hugh of the Maypole, "I guess we shall know
who made the stars now;" and last of all, but not
least, Pecksniff, the masterpiece of them all. From
boot to hat he is all over and all under, Pecksniff;
drunk or sober he is Pecksniff. He is the virtuous
Pecksniff all the time, and altogether. He hugs himself
to his own heart as the embodiment of all the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
virtues of the decalogue and the beatitudes. No
matter into what rascality he may be plunging, his
serene self conscious virtue never forsakes him.
The child wife, too, passes by us into the spirit land,
and there is the beautiful, dreamy eyed Agnes, who
quite charms us with her love and trust, and the
sad, calm face of Florence looks timidly upon us;
and Mrs. Jellyby tells us to look out for Borioboola
Gha; and poor Micawber informs us that
nothing has turned up yet, and hinting darkly
about laudanum and razors. What a marvellous
characterization! Will the world ever tire of this
man and his children, that he has materialized out
of ideals so unpromising; whom he has reared up
in the slums of London, many of them upon garbage?</p>

<p>The blessed Sabbath day was passing uneventfully.
There were no alarms from any source. Old
Hannah in her gloom was moving in and out of the
office and the "ole master" who had retired to his
bed chamber was weakening as the days would
come and go. Alice, with the acumen of an experienced
physician, was noting the changes from
time to time, and realized that the final change
would come some day and perhaps at an hour
least expected. The sad life of little Nell had
wrought upon her womanly feelings and she began
to think of herself, her situation, of her loneliness
should her father be taken from her, and
she thought of the crude inelegant suggestion of
old Clarissa.</p>

<p>"De crowsfoot is ergwine to cum into yer lubly
face, und kurlykus and frowns under yer eyes, und
what wud you do in dis grate big grate house, und
dis great big plantashun by yer lone lorn self."</p>

<p>The contemplation of such a situation could only
harrow her heart more and more, but there was
the gallant Arthur lying over in Virginia, and she
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
had plighted her troth to him that day, that she
reviewed the cavalry parade, when he stood by
her side so handsome, so happy, in his Confederate
uniform, with the nodding plumes in his hat,
when he said to her, "Sweet Alice, will you be true
to me until I return from the war?" And she promised
him with a kiss that she would; "and if dear
Arthur you shall never return, Alice will still be
true to you."</p>

<p>Is there no limitation to such a contract; are not
its conditions already performed? She asked herself.
Assuredly there are no marriages in Heaven.
She remembered that the Saviour of the world had
said to the Sadducees, "Ye do err not knowing the
scriptures, nor the power of God. For in the resurrection
they neither marry, nor are given in
marriage, but are as the angels of God in Heaven."
"Arthur knew that I loved him&mdash;that I loved him
from our childhood, and I am sure that our friends
as they enter the gates, are greeted by our friends
up there, and that they ask with so much interest
and affection about their loved ones in this sad,
lonely terrene.</p>

<p>If Arthur could speak to me now, and could
know that ere long I shall be bereft of the last
of my kindred, I am sure he would say to me with
a smile, "Sweet Alice, your loving heart has been
my own all these sad years, but we cannot marry
here, though we may be sweethearts. You require
a manly heart in which you may place your burdens,
and a manly bosom upon which you may recline
your tired, wearied head; strong arms that
shall shield you from every peril. Think of me
at the nuptial hour and know that I shall give
you away at the altar with my blessing and smile."</p>

<p>Thus ran the current of her meditation. Thus
in her fancy she was scattering over the flagstones,
in the nave of the old church, a sheen as of pure
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
gold. Tired out with these thoughts she fell
asleep in her chair, and her dreams were sweet and
refreshing until she was awakened by a gentle rap
upon the door which announced the presence of her
father.</p>

<p>Ned had now been installed as the butler at
Ingleside. Clarissa observing as he assumed his
untried office, "Dat Ned was more spryer und cud
fend fur hesef bettern oman fokses. What cud
wun lone lorn oman do ef de carpet-sackers shud
come back sho nuff. Old marser ort to fort ob dis
fo now."</p>

<p>The valuable estate of Burnbrae, an adjoining
plantation, had fallen under the auctioneer's hammer
for unpaid taxes and an overdue mortgage.
The old owner had struggled with adverse fate to
preserve it for his children, in the same plight it
had descended to him from his ancestors; saving
and excepting reasonable wear and tear and other
unavoidable casualties. This large estate of more
than two thousand acres had been purchased by
Judge Bonham with its impedimenta of freed
slaves that had been dumped into its cellars like
offal by the Freedman's Bureau.</p>

<p>This incident alone was a sad commentary upon
the times. From affluence to penury the descent
had been sheer and without the fault of Mr. Baring
the owner. Judge Bonham said to him however
that he should not want, and that he might
remain where he was at least for the present. The
purchasing of this property was the occasion of a
visit from that distinguished proprietor to Colonel
Seymour at Ingleside. Judge Bonham had been a
distinguished lawyer and jurist, and in the very
best of times had highly dignified his profession by
a seat upon the Superior Court bench. He was,
however, confronted now by a condition and not a
theory. He had interviewed from time to time the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
authors of his text books, digests and reports, but
from their dead lips came no satisfactory response to
the question, "What shall be done with these poor
negroes?" Thrust out of their home nests like unfledged
eaglets, their very sustenance precarious
and their condition the most pitiable and squalid.
Idlers and vagrants, watching like a shipwrecked
crew hopelessly for succor, when there is none to
come.</p>

<p>It happened that the judge and the Colonel were
in confidential communication for more than an
hour, and doubtless the subject was exhaustively
examined and reviewed, as if it were under a microscope.
The judge, had been a widower for a
few years, was a man of quite dignified presence,
and perhaps fifty-five years of age. He had seen
Alice but once before, at the Memorial exercises
at the cemetery, and to-day he contemplated the
southern beauty as if he were looking upon the
face of Beatrice Cenci as it smiles upon the throngs
from the gallery at Florence. Her exquisite grace,
her extraordinary beauty, rekindled instantly the
fire that had burned down into dead ashes so many
years ago.</p>

<p>He asked himself the question, "Can I be in
love? Have I been ensnared by the pretty fowler,
enmeshed by the witcheries, the fascinations of this
royal and unsophisticated beauty?" And all this
done and accomplished without the movement of a
finger upon her part.</p>

<p>"You, Livy Bonham, almost in the sere leaf, a
veteran of fifty-four years, striking the flag to a
feebly manned battery of bewitching blue eyes
before it has opened fire! Impossible! Impossible!"
This exclamation was just loud enough for the
Colonel to overhear, who enquired of the judge,
"what it was that was impossible?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, I was thinking if I couldn't persuade the
negroes to vacate my premises, that was all."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may find it necessary to consult you
further, say to morrow. You know I am living at
Burnbrae now, and the distance between us is very
short, and I am sure we shall become very intimate."</p>

<p>When the judge left the mansion the old man,
accompanied by Alice sought rest in the parlor
upon one of the mahogany sofas.</p>

<p>"And now my daughter you will please take up
your book again and read to me. What are you
reading," he continued.</p>

<p>"I was reading just then my dear father," the
girl replied, "about the death of little Paul Dombey.
I never weary of sentiments so heart pervading
that I find running like golden threads through
all of Dickens' works. You remember little Paul,
father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, oh yes," replied the old man, "Read it all
over again."</p>

<p>And Alice in her sweet, musical voice read so
soothingly to her father that he sank to sleep.</p>

<p>Closing the door softly behind her she went out
into the verandah and sang quite plaintively one
or more old songs, it might have been for the little
birds that were piping their notes too in the tree
boughs above her.</p>

<p>Shall we slip away from Alice for a moment to
invade the privacy of the judge?</p>

<p>If the judge had knowledge of our unbidden
presence, would he not say in the law latin that we
had committed a trespass, "<i>quare clausum fregit</i>?"
Oh, no, it would flatter him immensely to suspect
that he was in love, and that with the beauty of
Ingleside. He was stupidly ignorant after propounding
the question a score of times to himself,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
his answer, dubiously made, was always, "Well,
we shall see perhaps."</p>

<h3>THE ABSENT-MINDED JUDGE.</h3>


<p>Burnbrae, the home of the Barings, with its productive
acres fringed by vine-clad vales and hills,
had by an irrevocable event passed irredeemably
out of the possession of its embarrassed owner,
and heart-broken the old man yielded his tenure
to the new master. The mortgage debt and taxes,
like omniverous caterpillars, began to eat away at
its four corners at one and the same time. Mr. Baring
could only await the inevitable hour with the
saddest apprehensions. For himself it was a matter
of little consequence, for like the sea-tossed sailor,
he could discern within the length of a cable the
ultimate haven, land-locked and tranquil; but for
his two daughters who would survive him the
stroke was almost heart-crushing.</p>

<p>The forced sales of beautiful homesteads like
Burnbrae, in the days of reconstruction were not
much of an incident; when there was no halting
by that unbrigaded army that was laying waste
field and plantation, and scourging the land into
nakedness; when by the extra judicial processes of
assimilation and absorption the spoils system was
budding into a vigorous life and the spoilsmen were
animated, remorseless and persevering.</p>

<p>Around this home there were memories dear and
tender, trellissed in the affections of the Barings;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
incense came forth from chambers and bowers, and
out yonder where the smooth white stones glisten
in the moonlight like platoons of white-gowned
maidens, the Baring generations lay in unbroken
files.</p>

<p>It is a sad thing to see a home, like a worthless
chattel, under the hammer of a callous-hearted
auctioneer; to hear him cry going, going, going,
with as much delight as if he were parting company
with a pestilence; but alas! with the owner
it is like a judgment of outlawry to pass the keys,
the symbolical title, to the purchaser, who is animated
by no kind sentiment; who sees no tears and
hears no sighs. "Going, going, going!" There slips
out of the master's control the nursery where infancy
was cradled, swathed in the manifolding of
love and tenderness.</p>

<p>I see in retrospection a beautiful young mother,
with a redundance of soft black hair as velvety as
the wing of a raven, with her foot upon the rocker
smiling so sweetly upon the sleepy-eyed child, who
arouses her little tired self only long enough to
whisper dreamily,</p>

<p>"Sing please, again, mama; sing Dix&mdash;" and
falls asleep. And then there is the old conservatory
just under mother's window, aromatic with memories.
Mother called it her "Flowery kingdom,"
because every morning and every evening she entered
her throne-room there with its dais of japonicas
and camelias; and there were her little maids
of honor in russet and gold and carmine glistening
in dewy diamonds and pearls; and they would thrust
back their silky night-caps and their little eyes
would be bright, as they peeped out of tiny hoods
of blue and purple, red and white. Ah, this was
a royal realm of the queen mother, and those little
star rayed princesses were so loyal in their beauty
and fragrance. And this, too, like a beautiful pantomime,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
was passing away, leaving only shadows
that, like some horrid dream, were darkening the
soul. Oh, the charm, the aroma of the vine-clad
conservatory, dear mother's "Flowery kingdom"
and her little royal maids?</p>

<p>And there is the old drawing-room with a bountiful
bouquet of memories. This hallowed chamber
was so often refreshed in the golden twilight by
mother's presence, by mother's devotions, by mother's
voice as it blended softly with the harmonies
of the old harpsichord; and it seems as if there
were sweet chimes out of doors in the stilly air,
and perhaps the stars were re-enforcing the old
songs with whispering symphonies.</p>

<p>Then there was the chamber just next to mother's,
embowered in columbine and the trailing arbutus
where there are treasured still old letters, books
and shoes and articles of vertu that belonged to
Walter; just where he placed them before he enlisted
in the Confederate cavalry; before he died and was
rudely buried without a winding sheet, under the
clods of the Shenandoah valley, that day that Stonewall
Jackson unfurled the star barred banner in the
streets of Winchester; to rest, aye, to rest until the
bugler of the skies shall pipe the reveille. Going,
going, going. It is the knell of happy days; the
dirge of hearts crushed by sacrifices, sorrows; it is
the thud of the cold clay upon the coffin of hope;
the shroud that a remorseless destiny has flung
around our idols as they fall one by one from their
pedestals. "Going, going, going," the echo is thrust
back upon the bruised heart from the white cold
stones out yonder under the Mulberry. Perhaps
Mr. Baring's daughters, who planted about these
sacred mounds the star eyed daisies and the lily
white violets, never thought of the dance that
should go on and on to the fascination of lute and
harp in the resounding halls, when the stranger
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
should occupy in his right dear old Burnbrae. So
bewildering are the changes in this life. It seems
to them but yesterday that their lovely sister, a
maiden of sixteen years, was laid away by the side
of their mother, to arise one day transfigured and
glorified; and now they were going to tell the old
home with its cherished memorials good-bye; and
the old graveyard and mother's vine clad "Flowery
kingdom" too. Ah, every footfall is like an
echo from some deserted shrine; and there is no
kind voice to bid them "come again." The little
twittering birds are piping the refrain of the sad,
sad song of the auctioneer. Others enter now with
the keys of a lawful dominion; they unlock the
dead chambers, but the fragrance of happy lives is
gone like the breath exhaled from the nostril. The
stranger never heard the old harpsichord with its
responsive chords, as they were swept by mother's
lily white hands and almost syllabled her angel
voice. They were never charmed by that sweet sunny
voice that in so many twilights has been singing
vespers in heaven; they know naught of the dead
white ashes that lay in the unlighted furnaces of
the poor souls, who are saying now so tenderly, so
tearfully, to their old home and its memorials, its
idols, "Good-bye, good-bye!"</p>

<p>Judge Bonham, the purchaser, had been highly
distinguished in the civic and military employments
of the country. Like his old friend, Colonel
Seymour, he was with Lee at Spottsylvania, Gettysburg
and Appommattox, and like his colleague in
the humiliations of the hour he had declined to
"bend the pregnant hinges of the knee that thrift
may follow fawning." To say that under all circumstances
he maintained a perpendicular, from
which there was no swerving backwards or forwards or
to the right, or the left would be a falsification
of biography. He, like all other mortals
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
upon this terrene had his passions, when his temper,
despite curbs and restraints, almost overmastered
him. Judicial experiences had affected his
manners, so that he appeared austere and unfriendly;
but he had a kind heart, open-handed to
a fault, true to his convictions, his friends, his God.</p>

<p>There were curves and lines in the physical man
here and there that appeared misplaced and misshapen.
His long stringy hair or what there was
left of it, was of a carrotty color, his nose was aquiline
with unnatural projections, and his mouth
though a little rigid in outline displayed, when
animated, a beautiful set of teeth.</p>

<p>He was a very scholarly man; a religious man
too, and entertained throughout his life strong Calvinistic
convictions. It was strange indeed that a
gentleman so exemplary in life, should sometimes
run the hazard of being suspected as a rogue by
those who were ignorant of the infirmity that harassed
him all of his years. When meditating
upon this playfulness of nature he would observe
confidentially, that in any community where he
was not known he would be oftener in the State's
prison than without it.</p>

<p>"Better a Bedouin in the trackless desert than a
man who is forever running the gauntlet at such a
risk," he said embarrassingly.</p>

<p>There was the gossip of the town in which
he lived as biting as the hoar frost, revamped
and magnified to his hurt. When the gossipping
spinsters heard that the judge was reinforcing
his natural attractiveness by the glossiest and
finest of raiment, coming out of the wardrobe like
the butterfly out of the chrysalis, they hurried to
and fro among the neighbors, like magpies chattering
and twittering, and they laid the poor fellow
under the power of an anodyne upon the cold marble
slab, and with scalpels scarified him horribly,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
as some women only can do. "Did you ever! Did
you ever!" came a refrain from puckered lips.</p>

<p>"Who would have believed it!" exclaimed Miss
Jerusha Timpkins, as she rolled up her dancing
eyes and clasped her bony hands as if in expostulation.</p>

<p>"The idea! The idea!" ejaculated Miss Narcissa
Scoggins.</p>

<p>"That man going to marry!" they all exclaimed
in chorus. "My, my, my!"</p>

<p>"And pray who told you so?" asked Miss Jemima
Livesay with a biting expression.</p>

<p>"Why, where have you been, Jemima, all these
months, you ain't heard it? It is the town talk. Why,
Amarylla Hedgepeth she heard it straight from the
knitting society. Squire Jiggetts told old Deacon
Bobbett that the judge had spoken to him to marry
him to the beautiful Alice Seymour, and Deacon
Bobbett told his wife, and Mrs. Bobbett told Sarah
Marlow, and Sarah Marlow told Polly Ann Midgett,
and Polly Ann ups and tells Martha Gallop,
and that's how the news gets to us strait."</p>

<p>"Well sir!" exclaimed Miss Serepta Hightower,
forgetting she was speaking to old maids who had
a loathing for any expression that suggested a man
or the name or the memory of a man, except the
man they were prodding and scarifying. "I wouldn't
believe it if the news came pine blank from the
clouds; that I wouldn't!" and she gave emphasis
to the utterance by the malicious and vehement
stroking of one skinny fist against the other.</p>

<p>"Why, that man?" she exclaimed with horror,
"Why, he would forget his marriage vows before
he ever made them. Why when he led Malindy
Hartsease a blushing bride to the altar thirty years
ago; why, don't you all remember that he sauntered
out of the church by his lone lorn self, and the
preacher had to go to his house in the dead of night
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
in the rain and tell him that he had left his bride
in the church crying her very eyeballs out?"</p>

<p>"The monster! the monster!" all exclaimed and
skinny hands and skinny arms and skinny necks
were tossing and swaying automatically.</p>

<p>"Of course I warnt there myself (nor I either, came
interruptions from all the spinsters) but I heard my
mother,poor soul, say that she was right there and
that she never felt so sorry for a poor human being
in all her life as she did for poor Malindy; but she
has gone to her rest now, thank the Lord!" and a
dozen handkerchiefs instantly gravitated toward a
dozen hysterical faces.</p>

<p>"I pity any poor soul that ties herself to such a
man as that from the bottom of my heart," said
Miss Anastasia Perkins in great sympathy. "Why
she won't know whether she is married or not,
neither will he; just as likely as not he will go
courting somebody else with his poor wife a sitting
back in the chimney corner in the ashes."</p>

<p>"And there is another pint I haint ever said anything
about, but I think it ought to be known here
betwixt ourselves and not to go any further" said,
Miss Martha Gallop "but the way he treated his
poor wife Malindy was a purified scandal. Now I
aint a telling you this as coming from me, for the
good Lord knows when that thing happened,I
was a little teensy weensy tot, (with a coquettish
toss of her antique head) but old aunt Mehetibel
Parsley knows all about it, and I've heard her say
over and over again that when Judge Bonham and
Malindy would be riding in their carriage to meeting
that he would forget where he was going and
would fetch up right against the poor house three
miles or more in the other direction, and that poor
mournful woman would be a sitting back in the
carriage with eyes as red as a gander's, and a looking
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
pine plank like she was coming from a funeral."</p>

<p>"Oh the cruel, cruel monster!" came another refrain,
and skinny fists would double up and strike
against ancient knees like resounding boards, and
the spinsters would all heave great, tumultuous sighs,
and corkscrew curls, like spiral springs, would dance
up and down mechanically upon their well oiled
pivots.</p>

<p>Judge Bonham was quite nervously gravitating
toward a situation that required great force of
character; a situation always extra hazardous and
demanding the exercise of every resource.</p>

<p>This phlegmatic man was running the biblical
parallel, dreaming dreams and seeing visions; not
the distorted creations of the night-mare, but beautiful
little crayons of love, swinging like tiny acrobats
from blue ribbons on the walls, and descending
like vagrant sunbeams upon the vermillion carpet;
composite faces, too, with bright golden hair
and brighter blue eyes.</p>

<p>The old gentleman sat back in his easy chair,
thinking of the captivating beauty over at Ingleside,
and there were ecstatic little chimes ringing
in his ears, and their chorus always was this,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I don't care what the gossips say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall marry some fair day."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"But am I really in love?" asked he. It was a
perplexing question to a mind unusually acute and
active in the powers of analysis and synthesis; to
a mind that could grasp, multiply and divide remainders,
particular estates and reversions in all
their infiniteness. And the old man began to ponder
seriously upon the situation.</p>

<p>Something quite unusual and quite unnatural
was tinkering upon the frayed out heart strings of
the old judge, until the learned man quite bewildered
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
found himself addressing his reflected image
in the mirror.</p>

<p>"Quite handsome, upon my honor, Mr. Livy
Bonham," he exclaimed, "and she will say so, too,
when she sees her beautiful image in my soft
blue eyes; for they will speak to her in love and
she will understand."</p>

<p>He turned from the mirror singing sweetly,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And bright blue was her ee,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And for bonnie Annie Laurie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll lay me doon and dee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As he passed out of the door with his brand new
beaver hat canted to the right side of his head and
twirling his gold-headed cane in his hand, he said
to his old cook,</p>

<p>"Remember, Harriet, to come to me when I return,
as I shall have orders for a general cleaning
of the house by and by, and tell Lije to put the
carriage in apple-pie order."</p>

<p>"I wonder what mars judge do mean?" asked
the simple negro as she turned away, "Hit pears
lak his mind is a purified a wonderin; noboddy
haint rid in dat kerrige since ole missis died, und
it do seem lak a skandle to rub ole missis' tracks
out dis late day. Ef Mars Livy is agwine to get married

at de gal, und ax deyselves how cum she jined herself
to ole marser, wid wun foot in de grave, jes
to suck sorrer arter he is dun und gon."</p>

<p>The man of fifty-five years was met at the door
of Ingleside by the faithful old butler, who bowed
almost to the floor as he greeted the judge, who,
placing his hat into Ned's hands asked suspiciously
if his young mistress were at home?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>"Deed she is, mars jedge " exclaimed Ned obsequiously.</p>

<p>"Miss Alice is always at home to er yung gemman

mars jedge, in lilacks und princess fedders und jonquils,
jes lak she cum outen de observatory, und she
is speckin cumpany dis werry minit, und I spek
yu knose who dat is sar," said the old negro as he
dropped his voice almost to a whisper, laughing
and smirking the while.</p>

<p>"Angelic creature!" exclaimed the old man
aside, as he began to feel a creepiness up and down
his back like great caterpillars upon the march.
"What infinite comprehension!" he exclaimed
again as he seemed to jerk spasmodically; "What
an affectionate appreciation! Doubtless expecting
me as if my arrival had been telegraphed from Burnbrae."</p>

<p>"Mars jedge," asked Ned "dus you ame dis
wisit for yung missis or ole marser?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly, Ned, this visit is for your mistress,"
said the judge as he rubbed his hands with
energy. "When my plans are arranged I will interview
your marster&mdash;perhaps in the very near
future."</p>

<p>"Eggzackly, yung marser," replied Ned as he
twirled the judge's new beaver in his hand. "Mout
I mak jes wun kurreckshun, sar, fore yu gits too
fur?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly; what is it Ned?"</p>

<p>The old negro placed his hands to his lips as if
to keep back the sound of his own voice and asked
in a whisper, while a smile played around the
corners of his mouth, "Is you sho yus all rite,
boss?"</p>

<p>"Why certainly," the judge replied with a degree
of impatience "Do you suppose I have come
out of the low grounds?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lans saks, yung marser, dis ole nigger don't

But boss yu dun und flung yo oberkote on de rack,
duz yu ame to go into the parlor whar yung missis
is wid all her hallibooloos ur dout ary weskote ur
koller udder?" and the old negro turned away his
head and tittered, while the judge with the embarrassment
of a suspected felon was looking and feeling
for the missing garments; and he turned his
ashen face with a hard grimace to the old negro as
if he had been the cause of this particular act of
absent-mindedness and said angrily.</p>

<p>"Ned if you ever mention this matter to man or
beast your life shall pay the forfeit."</p>

<p>"Deed I won't, mars jedge, dat I won't, kase dat
mout fling de fat in de farr."</p>

<p>"What shall I do, Ned?" asked the judge confidentially.</p>

<p>"Hit pears lak dat de onliess fing yu can do now

<p>"No, I will go back home; and shall I come again
Ned?"</p>

<p>"Sartainly mars jedge, sartainly sar," said Ned,
bowing and scraping. "Ef you seed all dat finery
Miss Alice has got strowed around her neck und

<p>The foolish widower passed out of the door and
out of the gate singing to himself,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p>His feelings toward the peerless beauty were stoutly
reinforced by the observation of the negro "und all
dun und dun for yu mars jedge." Clarissa ever
and always upon the lookout in these suspicious
times, hearing only snatches of the conversation in
the hall between the judge and her husband called
out imperiously,</p>

<p>"Ned cum to de do er minit," Ned in his slouchy
way, giggling like an idiot, advanced toward Clarissa.</p>

<p>"Whot ailed dat white man in dem fine cloes und
stove-pipe hat agwine outen de gate?" and Ned
only giggled the more.</p>

<p>"Don't yu heer me axing you Ned?" stormed
Clarissa.</p>

<p>Ned still giggling with both hands to his black
mouth replied distrustfully.</p>

<p>"I gin mars jedge my solum wurd dat I wudn't
woice dat diffikilt twixt me und him to man nur
cattle beastis nudder."</p>

<p>"Woice what diffikilt Ned?" asked Clarissa in
her provoking way. "You knows I haint no man
nur cattle beastis nudder; whot maks yu so tantilizin?
Ef you haint agwine to tell me I'm agwine rite
strate to Miss Alice; I knows she will mak yu tell
her." Ned buried his face in both hands and
then peeping through his fingers sheepishly observed,</p>

<p>"Now Clarsy you knows you is monstrous
handy noratin ebery blessed fing you heers to tuther
fokses; now ef I ups und tells yu,und it gits to
mars jedge's ears, whose agwine to stand twixt me
und him? Tell me dat."</p>

<p>"I'm agwine to stan betwixt yu und de jedge,
dats who," replied Clarissa consequentially.</p>

<p>"Oh Lordy! Yu ergwine to stan twixt me und
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
him," interrogated old Ned contemptuously "Jes
as well have ole Jube er stanin twixt me und de
jedge ebery bit und grane."</p>

<p>Clarissa thought for a moment and replied with
infinite satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Miss Alice is ergwine ter stan twixt yu und
de jedge, dats who."</p>

<p>"Dat mout do," said Ned, "und ef de jedge axes
me about it I'm agwine to send him rite strate to Miss
Alice, und let dem two fite it out twixt dey selves,"
and Ned with great circumstantiality placed Clarissa
in possession of the facts in the case.</p>

<p>"Fo de King!" exclaimed Clarissa after Ned had
concluded. "I'm ergwine rite strate und tell Miss
Alice."</p>

<p>"Und den dars is gwine to be a rumpus in dis
grate house," said Ned with disgust as Clarissa
shuffled down the hall to her young mistress's
chamber.</p>

<p>Nothing baffled by his misadventure, and realizing
that faint heart ne'er won fair lady, the judge
reappeared at the hall door of Ingleside with his
beaver hat canted on the other side of his head,
and rang the door bell quite tentatively, as he
felt that Ned would watch for his coming, and
would admit him without knocking.</p>

<p>"Now Ned," the judge remarked, as he passed his
beaver to the old negro, "examine me from head to
foot and tell me if I'm all right." Ned did as he
was commanded in great detail of inspection and
observed,</p>

<p>"Yes sar, dat yu is, mars jedge, I neber seed such
a portly yung man in all my days sar. Pend upon
it boss, Miss Alice is ergwine to bite at the hook
fore yu flings out de bate. Ef I mout tell yu de
truf you looks lak yu was a stepping into de marrage
sallymony dis werry minit und I don't speck

sweet betsies is ergwine to drap rite down und perish
on yung misses hed when yu put your little
foot in dat dar parlor;" and the vain old man now
fully reassured, followed the old butler into
the parlor, the latter remarking in a highly patronizing
way.</p>

<p>"Now, mars jedge, I'm ergwine to set yu down in
de bridegroom's cheer, kase I knows hit is ergwine
to be yourn fore dis yeer is dun und gon, und
den I'm ergwine to be yourn too," he laughingly
continued. "Kase I belongs to yung missis und
yung missis belongs to de jedge. Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>After Ned had retired to the hall the vain old
man, after looking all around him, stealthily arose
from his seat and surveyed his person in an elaborate
mirror over the mantle piece, arranging his hair,
beard, and eyebrows in every detail of evenness and
position, and was thus assaulted by the bewitching
beauty of Ingleside without a picket or skirmish
line, and with his back to the conqueror of hearts.
The dilemma was excessively embarrassing and as
he turned to speak to the queenly beauty he began
to stammer and quite unconsciously to make
apologies.</p>

<p>"I called this morning, madam," he began, "er,
er, er, to inquire after the health of your father.
You don't know er, er, er, how solicitous I have
been about him of late. How is he this morning?"</p>

<p>"He is very much better, I thank you, sir," replied
Alice with an effort at self control, "and if
you will excuse me I will inform him that you
are here."</p>

<p>"I beg you will er, er, er"&mdash;stammered the judge
with an uncontrollable energy.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am sure it will do him so much good to
see you," interrupted Alice, as she gracefully bowed
herself out of the room, leaving the bewildered
lover to destroy with huge battering rams the beautiful
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
castle which his ardent fancy and old Ned's
sycophancy had erected.</p>

<p>"In olden times," soliloquized the judge, as he
brought his clenched hand with force upon his
knee, "kings alone had their fools; and here I am
playing the miserable fool in the presence of an
unsophisticated maid. Father indeed! Why did I
ask about her father, blasted idiot that I am?"</p>

<p>The old judge was still scourging himself with
the thongs of emphatic rebuke, when to his surprise
another judge entered the parlor with the
beautiful Alice upon his arm.</p>

<p>Colonel Seymour and the two judges had met
before in the court room, and were now enjoying
themselves in an old-fashioned way in the elaborate
parlor of the old mansion.</p>

<p>Judge Bonham was very delicate and refined in
his compliments of his friend Judge Livingstone,
who in the niceties of the law "could divide a hair
'twixt the north and north-west side." He was the
judge who had extracted the poison sacs from the
fangs of reconstruction; the judge who had stampeded
the vile and vicious hordes that thronged
and polluted the temple of justice. As Judge Bonham
looked at the man, he felt that the entreaty
of the South had been answered by the Power that
rules in heaven and earth.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"God give us men; a time like this demands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great minds, strong hearts, true faith and willing hands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men whom the lust of office cannot buy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men who have honor and will not lie."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These gentlemen had scarcely begun to sap the
foundations of the superstructure of reconstruction,
when dinner was announced by the beautiful
hostess, who stood in the door, as judge Bonham
declared, encircled in a cincture of angelic grace.
It was a bountiful meal; there were cheer and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
laughter and polite jest at the board, and as these
distinguished gentlemen were bowing themselves
out of the dining room, Judge Bonham was observed
by Clarissa to take a napkin ring from his
plate and put it in his pocket; with rolled up eyes
and wide open mouth, Clarissa looked like a black
idol in a Chinese temple. The guests again assembled
in the library and Alice busied herself in
arranging the table for tea.</p>

<p>"What sorter man is dat tother jedge Miss
Alice?" asked Clarissa in an authoritative kind of
a way. "I don't mean dat shiny-eyed jedge, but dat
man dat has got dem grate big warts on his nose.
Ef dat ar jedge cum to dis grate house many mo
times ole missis silver is agwine to be all gone.
She tole me to look arter her plunder. I don't
ame to sass dat ar jedge Miss Alice, but de fust
time I ketches him to hissef I'm ergwine to ax him
please turn dem dere pockets rong side outtards
und lemme see what he has got stowed erway in
dere. Dem kote skeerts haint er bulgin out datterway

scalyhorgs, wun is jamby ez big er fellum ez de
tuther; he ergwine erbout punishin tuther fokses
for gwine rong, und he, yu mout say, is er conwick
hissef. I nebber seed wot yu mout call a high
quality white pusson steal yo fings rite fore yo
eyes in de broad open daylight lak dat."</p>

<p>"You must not talk that way about Judge Bonham,
Clarissa," rejoined Alice with irritation. "I am
ashamed of you! What would father say if he were
to hear you accuse his guest of stealing!" Alice
continued rebukingly.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Alice," said Clarissa apologetically,
"It mout be dat I spoke too brash; seems lak do ef
he was a sho nuff jedge he orter have mo manners
dan agwine erbout shoolikin und pilferin lak dat;
speks ef dat white man was sarched yu mout find

udder wallybles belonging to dis grate house in his
hine pockets dis werry minit; yu dun und heerd me
say dem dar kote skeerts aint a bulging out dat dar
way fur nuffin." Clarissa with malice prepense
was arraigning the judge upon a cruel indictment,
a prejudiced prosecution and a predetermined verdict
evidently. There was but one plea that could
avail the judge if Clarissa were polled as the jury,
and that would require the immediate restitution
of the stolen property, and an unconditional withdrawal
from old marser's great house; or to punctuate
the verdict in Clarissa's emphatic way,</p>

<p>"Don't yu never set yo foot in dis heer grate
house no mo, epseps yu want ole Jube to wour yu
up with wun moufful, ef dem is all de manners yu
got."</p>

<p>"Permit me to ask you sir," observed Judge Bonham
to Judge Livingstone, "if the conditions prevailing
in the South are not entirely unlike those
that obtain in the North?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," replied Judge Livingstone. "It
would be difficult to realize that we live under the
same Federal government. Society in this country
seems to be thoroughly disorganized. I can imagine
that some great upheaval of nature has widely
separated the South from the North."</p>

<p>"I presume," said Judge Bonham, "that you have
seen southern character in all of its transformations
in your courts?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir, and very frequently in its most abhorrent
and disgusting forms. There is such a variety
of indictable frauds and many of them growing out
of the rudimentary education of the negroes, that
this fact, in my opinion, is the most cogent argument
against their education."</p>

<p>"I am very decidedly of that opinion," replied
Judge Bonham with emphasis. "I believe if it were
not for the criminal class of young negroes there
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
would be very few indictments in the courts; but
as the matter stands they are congested to that extent
that our jails are always over crowded and so
are our dockets."</p>

<p>"Do you know, sir," replied Judge Livingstone,
"that there is a side to this ever-shifting panorama
that challenges my profoundest sympathy? To
give you an illustration: A few days ago, in this
county of F., I saw in the dock a decayed old negro,
who staggered into the bar from sheer exhaustion.
He was dying piece-meal from starvation.
He was indicted for the larceny of a peck of sweet
potatoes. The prosecuting witness was a white
man of about forty years of age, and was what is
provincially known as a scalawag. I do not exaggerate
very grossly when I say that a blacksmith
would have hammered a plowshare out of his hard
face. The old negro was convicted; he had no
substantial defence. I said to him, 'I want you to
tell me why you took the potatoes.' The poor old
negro leaned heavily with both hands upon his
staff, his unshorn white locks giving him the appearance
of a 'sheik of the desert,' and raising his
harrowed face, that was wet with tears, tremblingly
addressed the court as he grasped the railing
for support, 'Mars Jedge, I hab neber nied dis
scusashun, und I tole de boss man ef he wudn't
sen me to de jail I wud wurk hit out ef hit tuck
seben yurs. I libs erway ober yander cross de

und I tuck um und toted um home in my pocket
ter de po little parishin yunguns, und&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Here the old negro broke down and cried as if
his heart would break, and then wiping his eyes
with his ragged coat sleeve, he continued,</p>

<p>"Und den dey tuck me und put me in de jale;
und I axed de high shurriff ter please git wurd ter
ole marser whar I wuz karserated, und he neber
sont no wurd ter ole marser. Marser Jedge, I'm ergwine

nex Juvember, ef I don't make no mistake I'll be
gwine in er hundred. I aint neber been kotched
in no scrapes befo in my born days, has I ole marser?'
Then turning to a white-haired man on the
jury, 'Nary body, white er cullud, hab eber crooked
de finger at enyfing I eber dun rong, und I'm
too ole und crazyfied to be sont to de penitenshury,
und fur de Lawd's sake, Mars Jedge, please don't
sen me dar, ef yu duz my po little yunguns will
parish ter def, und I axes all yu white gemmen on
dat jurrer ter pray fur me, und de jedge too.'</p>

<p>"The court and jury were in tears when this eloquent
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
plea was concluded, and the poor old negro,
shaking from head to foot, sank back into his seat,
bowed his white head upon his staff and covered
his black face with his old hat. There was a painful
pause in the court room; handkerchiefs were
freely displayed here and there, and ominous
sounds, as if there was weeping, was heard in the
great press of people."</p>

<p>"What is your name?" asked the judge, addressing
the white-haired juror in the box to whom
the old negro had appealed as his master.</p>

<p>"Grissom," modestly replied the man.</p>

<p>"Do you know the character of this old negro?"
asked the judge.</p>

<p>"Very good, very good sir," the juror excitedly
repeated, "trustworthy and truthful under all
circumstances sir."</p>

<p>After a moment's reflection the judge said to the
old negro, "Stand up old man." The negro reeling
from weakness raised his bowed, palsied frame,
and repeated after the judge the formula used in
recognizances as follows substantially.</p>

<p>"I duz hereby nowledg dat I is debted to de
State of Norf Caliny in de sum ob ten millun dollars
to be leveled pun my goods und cattle, lans
turnements und harry dettyments to be woid on
kondishun dat I maks my pussonel pearance fo de
jedge of dis kote next Christmas und bide by de
jedgement of dis kote."</p>

<p>"Now old negro," said the judge sympathetically,
"You can go home."</p>

<p>"Tank yer mars jedge," he exclaimed as he advanced
to grasp the judge's hand.</p>

<p>"May the good Lord in heaben allus be rite by
your side when yu gibs jedgement." Taking up
his old hat he bowed to the gentlemen of the jury
with the observation,</p>

<p>"May nun of you white gemman ever git kotched
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
in such a scrape as dis, epseps yu has dis heer
jedge to stand twixt yu und de gallus." He turned
again to the judge with a smile that played like
sheet lightning over his haggard face and inquired
humbly.</p>

<p>"Mars Jedge, duz yu specks me to pay dat passel
of munny to de state nex Krismas too?"</p>

<p>At the conclusion of this narrative our mutual
friend Judge Bonham arose to take his leave, remarking
as he did so "that his visit should be long
remembered, that his distinguished friends were so
agreeable;" and grasping the hand of the judge he
congratulated him and the country that "a Daniel
had come to judgment." When the absent-minded
gentleman arrived home, his servant Lije discovered
that the judge's head down to his ears was immersed
in a light derby hat, and he ventured to ask,</p>

<p>"Mars Jedge, what you agwine to do wid dat dar
hat? To be sho you didn't swop your brand new
slick beaver off for dat dar camp kittle?"</p>

<p>The judge in his chagrin saw that he had carried
away Judge Livingstone's derby hat and had left
his beaver in its place. And he said sharply to
Lije,</p>

<p>"Go through all of my pockets and see if I have
stolen any of the property of Colonel Seymour. I
dare not trust myself to visit a neighbor that I
am not liable to be sent to the penitentiary." The
negro Lije exploiting all suspected places exhibited
to the judge a table ring and napkin, that by
some inexplicable means had been transferred to
his pocket.</p>

<p>"Gracious heavens!" the humiliated man exclaimed,
"Larceny both grand and petit by the
eternal! Felony without benefit of clergy! Return
those stolen articles at once, you black scamp,
where they belong, and present my compliments to
Colonel Seymour, and tell him they got into the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
possession of Judge Bonham without his knowledge
and against his consent and bring back my
beaver and cane. Stop! stop!" he exclaimed excitedly,
"What is this?" drawing from his vest
pocket a small miniature of Alice that he had seen
upon the parlor mantel. "Great Jerusalem!" he
fairly shrieked, "condemned beyond the hope of
pardon."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>

<h3>THE DIPPING OF THE RED STARS.</h3>


<p>"Will you oblige me at the piano, Miss Seymour?"
Judge Livingstone asked, as they were
seated in the parlor at Ingleside after the retirement
of Judge Bonham.</p>

<p>With a show of embarrassment Alice consented
as the judge escorted her to the instrument.</p>

<p>"Shall I play your favorite?" she asked a little
coquettishly.</p>

<p>"Ah no; not mine, but yours, I beg, and please
accompany the chords with your own sweet voice,
will you not?"</p>

<p>Alice, thrumming the piano in a perfunctory
way, lifted her eyes to her guest as she replied
smilingly,</p>

<p>"I have no favorite, sir, indeed I have not. Shall
I play yours?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes; you may if you will not laugh at
my old-fashioned fancy. I do not mind telling
you that one of my favorites is, 'Then You'll Remember
Me.' I suspect that there are selections
from Beethoven, Mozart and Chopin that are inexpressibly
grand, but for soulful melody there is
nothing like the sweet, dear old song."</p>

<p>Alice threw her spirit into the old song, and with
eyes glistening through her tears, remarked sadly,
"This old melody is very dear to me, very, very
dear."</p>

<p>"I should imagine so," replied the judge, "and
I know if it could syllable its love it would tell
you of its passion for you. I think it has taken
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
possession of your whole heart, Miss Seymour,"
continued the high official with animation.</p>

<p>To this tentative kind of inquiry Alice did not
reply, but looked blushingly into the judge's
earnest face and sweetly laughed, like the artless
girl she was.</p>

<p>The golden hours were fast slipping away, and
the little goldsmith was hammering, too, at the
tiny arrows.</p>

<p>"I fear I have afflicted you very cruelly, my
sweet friend," the judge observed after a pause, as
he noted that the hour hand of the ivory time
piece upon the mantel had run its circuit eight
times in succession. "I doubt not that I have wearied
you by the unreasonable length of my visit;
but like a bound captive, I have been held in thrall
with silken chains for forty-eight hours."</p>

<p>"And have you really enjoyed the time?" she
asked, quite artlessly.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear Alice," he now ventured to address
her, "I am in love&mdash;enmeshed in the delightful
toils of the most beautiful woman in the wide,
wide world. Will you permit me to declare my
passion&mdash;my love&mdash;for my queen, my beauty? To
tell you that I have been captivated by the only
girl that can under all circumstances make me happy?
And can you, my sweet Alice, reciprocate the
feeling?"</p>

<p>There was no response from the girl, but her
soul was thrilled by an experience new and exciting,
and she buried her face in her hands for the
moment.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is very little to interest a third
party in the initial chapters of a love story; there
are to be sure the old fancies that are animated,
then its incidents become melodramatic, and then
we laugh, and then possibly forget. As Alice
raised her eyes to the portrait just above the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
piano, her face radiant as it were with an indescribable
beauty, the enamored judge looked into
the lustrous blue eyes and felt that he read within
their azure depths, the passion of a beautiful
woman's love; and with much confusion he observed,</p>

<p>"Perhaps Alice, I have originated a surprise for
you; please do not be alarmed if my feelings have
overmastered my discretion."</p>

<p>The embarrassed girl essayed quite tactfully to
withdraw the attention of her suitor from the subject
he was nervously pressing, and pointing to
the portrait of a gentleman wearing the stars of a
colonel in the Confederate army, she asked him if
he recognized her father in the painting.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she remarked without awaiting
an answer "that I feel inexpressibly sad when
I think of our poor boys who wore the gray in the
bloody battles of the South?" and a tiny tear
quivered in her soft eye.</p>

<p>"I doubt not," replied the judge in sympathy
with her feelings, that the retrospection is extremely
painful. "I am sure that I have reason to
deplore a catastrophe, that over laid our beloved
country as with a shroud."</p>

<p>"You were not a soldier in the Union army?"
she suggested interrogatively.</p>

<p>"And could you respect me if I were?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," Alice replied without hesitation, "you
have been so true to the South in the character of
judge I can and do honor you, and I am quite sure
if you were a Yankee soldier you believed you
were performing your duty."</p>

<p>"My sweet Alice," he exclaimed. "Don't let us
have Yankee soldiers in this beautiful Southern
home; you don't know how opprobriously the term
Yankee sounds to me. I was a Union soldier and
fought under the Stars and Stripes, through the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
bloody battle of Manassas, and can my rebel sweetheart
forgive me?" he asked, as he timidly took her
soft hand in his own.</p>

<p>"Assuredly sir," she replied "if you will give
me your word upon honor, that you never shot our
poor boys in the battle; now did you?" she feelingly
asked as she looked into his face, aglow with the
holy passion of love.</p>

<p>"No," he replied emphatically, "but if I had
carried a musket instead of a sword I would have
done my duty."</p>

<p>"Do you know sweet Alice that whilst there
were frowning clouds upon the horizon,there were
rainbows with bright hues that bridged them over;
that whilst there were incidents excitingly tragical,
there were experiences that provoked laughter
in camps and prisons? Let me give you a single
illustration that occurs to me just this moment, if
you will pardon me, and let me say that I am
convinced that it was patriotism that kept the
Confederate soldiers in the army, where they preferred
the thick of the battle, and sought death
itself as the highest reward of the brave. It would
illustrate our pride as a nation to put the gallant
soldiers of the South in an attitude of glory equal
to our own.</p>

<p>"I was assistant provost marshal at the military
prison at Point Lookout in the years 1863 and
1864, and I recall an amusing character who was
brought into the prison with a large number of other
prisoners who had been captured at Chancellorsville.
I think his name was Patrick Sullivan, a
red-haired freckled faced Irishman, clad in butternut
homespun; and every available square inch
of coat, vest, pants and hat was decorated by military
buttons of all kinds and sizes. I asked the prisoner
why this superfluity of decorations? and he answered
with a drawl as he squinted his left eye;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wall mister, I reckin ye haint hearn tell how
thrivin the cussed Yankees used to be down South
twell we un's got to thinnin em out sorter; they
come down thar pine blank in gangs, like skeeters
in the Savanny mashes, twell weun's run afoul of
em like a passel of turkeys chasing hopper grasses
in the clover patches; and bless your soul honey
the captain lowed that every dead Yankee would
fetch a gold dollar at pay day, arter we had licked
old Lincum; and I've got just nineteen hundred
and seventy-six ginerals and kurnels and captains
and privates in the rear rank to my credic at settlin
day. That thar button up thar in the tip end
of my hat was a Major, that was skeddadlin to the
rare arter weun's was plumb licked at Bull Run;
and that thar button on the tother end of the hat
was the fust giniral I kilt at Seben Pines; and
bless your soul honey, killing ginerals and majors
after that won't no more than shooting bull-bats
down in Georgy; and as to captains and leftenants,
I just flung them in with the foot cavalry
sorter pomiscuous."</p>

<p>"Sad to say," the judge continued, "the poor
fellow died in prison. We buried him with all
his generals and foot cavalry where the Potomac
sings its threnody by night and by day."</p>

<p>The narrative with the amusing grimaces of the
judge interested Alice, and she laughed until tears
came into her eyes. She became serious again
however, and asked her guest if he really participated
in the battle of Manassas.</p>

<p>"Yes indeed," he rejoined, "and my experience
in that battle was inexpressibly sad. I cannot think
of Manassas," he resumed, "that I do not recall
an incident full of pathos and glory. Without the
mechanism of a regular army; with a currency as
erratic as the proclamation money of the colonists,
without experience or discipline, they had the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
courage of Spartans; and the proud eminence they
assumed in every engagement made them heroes
in the forlorn struggle. There is not a single instance
upon record where the swords or guns of
the Southern armies were tarnished by ignoble
flight or inglorious surrender; and whenever their
flag was struck, it was because the elements of
resistance were exhausted. Sad indeed that the
drama should have begun and closed with such
heart-rending tragedies. Could I so order and
direct the policy of the government, I would
make the glory of our American arms as imperishable
as the Republicanism of our government.
I would make Gettysburg and Chancellorsville
to gleam through the haze of centuries like Marathon
and Plataea and upon each return of the
glorious anniversaries, I would find a Pericles to
proclaim from our American Acropolis the fadeless
glory of the men who wore the gray as well as
the men who wore the blue."</p>

<p>The impassioned eloquence of the distinguished
guest enthused Alice with a strange experience,
and in her discriminating judgment she discovered
a lover whose exalted spirit of patriotism, whose
fervid oratory, challenged her admiration. She
could only bow her thanks to her honored friend
whose role upon the tragic stage must have been
highly dramatic.</p>

<p>"I was a lieutenant in the twenty-sixth Pennsylvania
cavalry," he continued, "and at the head of
a squadron rode a dashing young Confederate
officer who, at the time I saw him, was in the
act of cleaving the head of one of our captains
with his sabre, when a shot from one of our
men arrested the sabre in mid air, and he fell
mortally wounded from the saddle. I instantly
dismounted and raised the young officer in my arms
who could only say, "Take the ring on my finger to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
my darling Al&mdash;&mdash;" and died. I have worn the
ring ever since, vainly prosecuting the search for
the true claimant. I presume that the owner will
never be found. You will observe from its facets
and artistic workmanship that the diamond must
be very costly; and if you will take it into your
hand you will read within the circlet your name
and mine, "Alice to Arthur"." The girl taking the
ring into her hands uttered a scream that pierced
the judge's soul, and she fell heavily upon the floor
in a swoon.</p>

<p>"Merciful Father in Heaven," exclaimed the
affrighted man in a paroxysm of agony. "What
have I done! what have I done!" Clasping the
unconscious girl to his bosom, he cried loudly for
help, and Clarissa ran in great agitation into the
room shrieking out in a delirium of fear.</p>

<p>"Mars jedge has yu dun und sassinated my yung
missis in cold blood in dis heer great house? If yu
has yu'l sho be swung on de gallus. Oh my
lands sakes alive! Jerrusulum my king!" and the
old negro ran frantically about the parlor, hither
and thither, over turning tables and chairs and
throwing info the face of her young mistress great
clusters of flowers and water and rugs which had
the happy effect of resuscitating the poor girl; and
on regaining her senses she looked dazedly up and
saw Clarissa coming with a teapot of boiling water,
with which the old negro in her transport was
about to parboil her young mistress. She motioned
Clarissa away, and as soon as she could control
her voice she said to the judge;</p>

<p>"Oh, how I must have alarmed you sir!"</p>

<p>"Ugh! My King!" interrupted Clarissa in her
grave earnestness "Yu knows yu skeert us jamby
to def; yu fokses aint fittin to stay in dis heer parlor
by yoselves, ef dem is de shines yu is agwine
to cut up; a little mo und yu mout been dead as a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
mackrel und den dat dar jedge mout be hung on de
gallus;" and with this unparliamentary speech the
old negro, decidedly out of temper with the situation
of persons and things, strode out of the room
muttering to herself as she closed the door, "I aint
satisfied in my mind pine plank whedder Miss
Alice had a sho nuff fit, or whedder she drapped
down dat dar way jest to be kotched up by the jedge
fo she hit de flo. Dese heer white gals is monstrous
sateful dat day is."</p>

<p>"You don't understand our maid," Alice observed
to her guest apologetically as Clarissa walked out
of the room. "We have to make allowances for
her." The judge could not speak for a while, for
Clarissa's oddities had thrown him into a fit of
laughter. After recovering himself he said argumentatively.
"I think I can see that the civilization
of the South will have lost much of its
fragrance when the old negroes are dead. The
history of your country has been refreshed by the
charm they have brought to it; and I doubt not
that despite their strong individuality, their crudities,
they will be sadly missed one of these days."</p>

<p>"Now that I have survived those ridiculous sensations
that quite overpowered me," Alice blushingly
remarked "will you accompany me for a moment?"
And the judge quietly assenting gave
Alice his arm not knowing whither she was leading
him. She paused before an exquisite painting
partially veiled by drapery, and bade him look
upon it. The judge obeying her command, saw
upon the wall the faithful portraiture of the handsome
young officer who was slain under his own
eye at Manassas; and from whose hand he had
taken the ring that had thrown Alice into the
swoon.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed emotionally "It is he, it is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
he, your lover, Alice, your brave soldier boy who
died for his darling, ever so far away."</p>

<p>"You will pardon my tears will you not?" she
asked entreatingly, "if I tell you that he was so
true, so good, so brave, that I loved him so
dearly?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can freely pardon, since you confide
your grief, your love to me. Take the ring Alice,"
he pleaded so eloquently, "Take it from Arthur
Livingstone, who loves you with his whole heart;
who has come to Ingleside, to your own sweet
bower, to your own dear self, to proffer his life,
his honor; to relight the candle upon the same altar,
upon which your brave soldier boy first lighted
it, when he proffered to you his life, his homage,
his all. He who returns the ring to you that you
gave Arthur Macrae, would take his place in your
heart and guard its portal with his life, until the
very stars shall pale their fires in the heavens
above. God in Heaven will ratify the compact,
and 'neither powers, nor principalities, nor things
present, nor things to come, nor life, nor death
shall separate us from one another.'"</p>

<p>A smile of unutterable joy was the only answer
she gave him.</p>

<p>"Now my darling," the judge pleaded passionately,
"in the presence of the angels and of your
own Arthur, let us plight our holy troth to one
another."</p>

<p>The girl sweetly looking into the radiant face
lovingly answered, "And Arthur has promised to
give me away at the altar, and to put the ring that
I gave him with my love; this ring upon my finger."</p>

<p>"Thank God," he exclaimed, in an ecstacy of feeling,
"the cup of my joy overflows," and pressing her
soft hand to his lips he kissed it over and over
again, and looking only as a lover can look into
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
her upturned face, beaming with happiness, he said,
"After all to what can I compare the love of a true,
beautiful woman?"</p>

<p>"May I guess?" she asked still laughing.</p>

<p>"Yes, oh yes," he rejoined.</p>

<p>"To the love of a true, manly man."</p>

<p>The scattered sun rays were coalescing and forming
a nimbus of beauty around every facade and
chamber, except one in Ingleside. Upon this threshold,
shadows were by turns advancing and receding.
The undiplomatic ambassador with his commission
of power to slay, without being outlawed
by any judicial tribunal, was inditing his judgment.
It ran in the name of Commonwealths and
States Universal. This Plenipotentiary had been
into this mansion before, but he came without terrors,
without equipages, without liveried slaves.
He came softly and sweetly. There were no harsh
commands that he uttered, no rattling of wheels
over cobble stones, no exhibition of a despotic
will.</p>

<p>"My daughter," he whispered "you are wearied,
come with me I will give you rest." Will he come
with this fascination again?</p>

<p>Here lies an old man broken like a wheel by the
force of cataracts and torrents, that have been increasing
their momentum for all these years, as
they have heaved and billowed over his poor
soul.</p>

<p>Pending the treaty of love in the parlor, old
Ned and Clarissa were holding a whispered conversation
in the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Ned," Clarissa asked in alarm, "did dat dar
jedge ax yu ary question about Miss Alice
when he cum in de do?"</p>

<p>"No, not pintedly," Ned answered.</p>

<p>Clarissa hung her head for a moment, and with
her old checked apron to her liquid eyes, she continued
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
sobbingly, "Dar is gwine to cum a breaking
up in dis heer fambly Ned, sho as yu born. I
seed it de fust time dat furrinner sot his foot in
dis heer grate house. Miss Alice aint neber had
her hart toched befo, but when he cum, her eyes
looked bright lak de stars, und a smile smole all over
her beautiful face, und she has been singing love
himes ever since, and dat dar jedge when he gets
whay Miss Alice is, is jes as happy as a mole in a
tater hill."</p>

<p>It was Ned's turn now to dash away a tear from
his leaky eyes, and with arms bent over his bowed
bosom, and with drooping head and a seesaw motion
he said, "Clarsy, I been a studdin erbout dis
heer situashun, und ef dat dar furriner tices yung
missis from dis heer plantashun, in de name ob
Gord what is agwine to come ob ole marser?"</p>

<p>"Yu better ax wot is agwine ter cum ob me und
yu. Ole marser is agwine away fust, yu heer my
racket. I dun heerd deth er calling him. Ole
marser walks rite cranked-sided now, wid dat
wheezin in his chiss, und twixt dese franksized niggers,
und dis outlandish konstrucshun, und ole
missis dun und gon, ole marser is er pinin lak a
dedded gum in de low ground."</p>

<p>"Eggzackly so, eggzackly so," ejaculated Ned,
"Wot is agwine ter cum of me und yu."</p>

<p>"Dares where yu interests me Ned; what is
agwine ter cum of me und yu sho nuff? Deres ole
Joshaway nigh erbout one hundred years ole, ded
und gon now, jes lived on de rode trapezing baccards
und furrards to de ole kommissary, wid his
happysack und jimmyjon as emty as my tub dere
wid nary botom, twell ole mars fotched him back
home; und pend pon it, Ned, ef Miss Alice don't
make some perwishun fur me und yu, we's agwine
to suck sorrow as sho as yer born."</p>

<p>"Dat's de gospil troof," replied Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>"Uncle Ned," came the voice of Alice from the
parlor, "Will you please bring Judge Livingstone's
hat to him?"</p>

<p>"Sartainly, yung missis," quickly the negro replied,
and he ran as fast as his stiff joints would
permit, and bowing very humbly, placed the hat in
the judge's hand.</p>

<p>"And will you not give me a kiss now in the
presence of your old servant?" asked the judge.
And the beautiful girl, half yielding, allowed her
lover to print one or more upon her rosy lips.</p>

<p>"Adieu my love, until I come again in October
to claim my own."</p>

<p>Alice returned to the parlor and threw her soul
into the old, old song, the judge's favorite, "Then
you'll remember me."</p>

<p>Ned shuffled back to Clarissa with his old bandana
to his eyes with the observation "Taint wuff while
to pester yosef er sobbing und er sighing no mo Clarsy,
I dun und seed de margige sealed und livered.
I heerd the nupshall wows sploding same as er passel
of poppercrackers."</p>

<p>"Oh my heavens," screamed Clarissa, as she
jerked her old apron to her eyes.</p>

<p>The three blood red stars were now blotted out
of the reconstruction calendar; like the painted
dolphins in the circus at Antioch, they had been
taken down one by one. The old Colonel had been
running flank and flank with the athletes of reconstruction,
but within the last stadium he had lost,
and the old man, like the fire scathed oak, was
yielding his life after all; dying like a gladiator
with his wounds upon his breast; dying, yet holding
fast to the traditions of his fathers, with no
blemish upon their name or his; with no bar sinister
upon the family shield; with no stain upon his
sword. Dying a Seymour, a soldier, a southron
of the bluest blood; dying with the prophecy upon
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
his lips, "The old South, by the help of God,
shall be crowned with all the blessings of civilization,
with the last and highest attainments in the
manhood and womanhood of her people," Dying
with another prophecy upon his lips, scarcely
audible, "My daughter, you will live to see the old
South, now reeling and tottering like a bewildered
traveller, come to her own again; like a magnanimous
queen, reigning in love and tranquility; her
soil yielding its harvest in bounty, and her people
blessed in basket and store."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>

<h3>THE PARTING OF THE WAYS.</h3>


<p>Afflictive dispensations had so often heaped up
against the horizon of Alice's affections, frowning,
angry clouds; the memory of bier and pall had so
cruelly overlaid her young life with its gloom that
but for the solace of religion, there would be no
refuge from the bitterness of her grief; from the
shadows of the grave. But in her mother's chamber,
with her mother's precious Bible in her hands,
she felt that there was a fountain opened up before
her, yes in the very house of David. "Blessed
Book! What is life without thee?" she exclaimed.
"Is it not a faithful transcript of the last
will of our Redeemer? Is it not the key that unlocks
the door of Heaven? Yea the guide that elaborates
its beauties? 'Eye hath not seen; ear hath
not heard; neither hath it entered into the heart of
man to conceive of those things which He hath
prepared for them that love Him.'" She felt that
in the world's tragedy of sin it was indeed a savor
of life unto life; that it erects in the human soul,
where there is sin, sorrow and despair, a sanitarium;
rendering good for evil, giving back pardon for
injury; preferring pity to vengeance; kneeling always
upon the heights of virtue to uplift the
broken-hearted. Whether its blessed truths be
spoken in prophecy or narrative; whether whispered
from the sepulchre or the crypt; whether thundered
from Sinai or Mars Hill; they tenderly lead
poor, fallen human nature into the portals of immortality,
into the very gate of Heaven. "Has
not religion," she asked, "given to humanity an uplifted
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
brow? Has it not admonished man to put
away from him every mercenary calculation and
to realize that the scourges of sin are rotting whip
cords? Ah yes, wherever there is a tear, there is
love, wherever anguish there is consolation, whenever
the night is dark and starless and there are
deep shadows, an angel stands with bowed head
and welcoming arms. What a balm for the scarified,
bleeding heart! A precious pearl of great price
in a casket of exceeding beauty; a sword of ethereal
temper that divides unto the sundering of
bone and marrow; but there are diamonds upon
the hilt and golden tracery upon the scabbard.
Ah, the resurrection, who gives this promise, this
faith, this hope? In all the dead aeons of dead
centuries, science, nature, man, have asked in vain
'If a man die shall he live again?'&mdash;But just as in
scaling a beautiful mountain, it needs no chemistry
to analyze the air, to tell us that it is free from
miasma, as every breath which paints a ruddier
glow upon the cheek and sends a tonic tide through
the body, will tell of its invigorating touch; so it
needs no analysis, no reasoning, to persuade a
spiritual mind that the air of Heaven, the breath
of God is in this book; and just as on Tabor's
brow, when from Christ His own glory pierced its
callous, unfeeling sides, it needed no refracting
prism to tell us that it was the sunburst of more than
earthly radiance the pilgrims were gazing upon.
So when a Bible chapter is transfigured, when the
Holy Spirit transmutes into it his grace and glory,
it will require neither a Paley or Shenstone to
prove that the power and wisdom of God are there;
but radiant with emitted splendor, in God's own
light we will see it to be God's own Book, and
know it to be His blessed revelation. 'I know
that my Redeemer liveth and that in my flesh I
shall see God.' The light of faith in the afflicted
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
man of God was burning feebly, but he begins to
feel now the strength, the virtue, which lies in innocency,
as if God were beginning to reveal Himself
within him. He heeds no longer the hyper-Calvinist
when he tells him, 'Thou has taken a
pledge from thy brother for naught, and stripped
the naked of their clothing; thou has not given
water to the weary, and thou hast withholden
bread from the hungry.' He raises his finger as
if he would command attention and exclaims, not
in irony, but in tranquil self-possession, 'God forbid
that I should justify you; till I die, I will not
remove my integrity from me. My righteousness
I will not let go. My heart shall not reproach me
so long as I live.'</p>

<p>"Pictorial scriptures, truly, comprehending all
manners, all conditions, all countries. Egypt with
the Nile and the Pyramids, the nomad Arabs, the
bewildered caravans, the heat of the tropics, the
ice of the north, are there; all save the frozen
heart of Jewish traditions and ceremonials. How
divinely transfigured every page of the precious
Book, wherein is life eternal!"</p>

<p>In the great voiceless halls and chambers there
was no sound but her poor, tumultuous heart beating
wildly against a bosom sore with weeping. Alas,
for ties that are so fragile, for pleasures that are
so transitory! Old Clarissa would steal tip-toe to
her chamber, but she dared not enter, and would
return as softly to the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Po Miss Alice, she do suffer mazin. Pears lak
ebery now und den when her eyes gits bright und
her face is sunny und sweet, und her lafter is lak
de ripplin ob de little brook in de medder, dat de
good Lord draps anudder drug in de cup und maks
her drink ebery drap. Dere aint a gwine to be no
mo sorrer for Miss Alice now; yung Mars Harry is
gon, und missis is gon, und ole marser is gon, und
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
bimeby her eyes is agwine to git bright agin,
und her purty solemcholly face is er gwine to be
full of smiles, und de little birds is ergwine to
hang dere heads und drap to sleep when she sings
dem lubly ole fashined himes agin."</p>

<p>The poor girl finally fell asleep. It was the
only anodyne that nature had in her laboratory
for a broken heart; and she slept as tranquilly as
a little child. She awoke refreshed by dreams,
peopled by friends of her early childhood, many
of whom were living and happy. She went into
the kitchen, to give directions to Clarissa, whom she
found at her accustomed labor. Crushed and
spiritless as she was, there was comfort for her in
the broken, incoherent utterances of the old negro.</p>

<p>"Don't cry no mo," said Clarissa quite sympathetically.
"I used to heer ole missis say when she
was ailin monstrous bad, dat ebery cloud had a
silver linin, und I beliebs it pine plank. I beliebs
dat when de good Lord sends trouble on dis here
lan He's ergwine ter sen grace too. Dat's my belief,
yung misses, und I'm ergwine to lib by it und
I'm ergwine to die by it. When I looked down into
ole marser's grave and seed all dem lilies ob de
walley kivered up in de dirt, I node de good
Lord was not ergwine to mommuck up ole marser's
soul fur nuthin. I node dere wuz ergwine to
be a transplantin in His hebenly garden of all de
beautifullest flowers dat withers and parishes here
in dese low grouns oh sorror, und I sez to mysef,
dat I specks ole missis is er runnin ter meet ole
marser dis bery minit, wid boff hans chock full
ob white roses und jonquils und lilies ob de walley.
Duz yer kno what I beliebs, Miss Alice?" she
continued, as she wiped her eyes in her old checked
apron. "When I sees a little white flower er
droopin und er dying in ole missis' garden, I nose
dat she hez cum down fru de purly gates to pull it
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
und tak it back in her busum to yung Mars Harry;
und when I sees a little teensy baby a droopin und
er dyin jest lak dat little flower, I nose de good
Lawd is er takin it home in His busum too. Wun
ob dese days yu und me is agwine ter see fur oursefs.
Bress de Lawd!"</p>

<p>The days were passing now so languidly, and
wretchedness was still brooding in the heart of
Alice. To one event, however, she looked forward
with intense yearnings. There was somewhere in
the wide, wide world a great sympathetic heart
perpetually telegraphing its love, and she was
feeling the electric current in its pulsations every
moment in the day. He had promised to come
again in the mellow, fragrant month of October,
before the flowers fade and die; when the artist of
nature is painting the foliage upon the trees green,
purple and golden, and with a richer iris the twilight
sky, and dappling the fleecy clouds. Yes,
he is coming, not as the judge of the assizes, but
as a prisoner of hope. Her affections hitherto
were divided&mdash;now he yearns for the whole heart.
Coming to endow her with a treasure selfishly coveted
above rubies and diamonds, above principalities
and thrones; coming to plight his troth at
God's altar, that in sickness and in health they
would cling to one another till death doth part
them.</p>

<p>How would Alice appear in her funereal robes
before him, before the altar? Perhaps Clarissa
can reassure her in this dilemma.</p>

<p>"Miss Alice," she exclaimed as she clapped her
hands approvingly, "If yer is as butiful when the
jedge cums as yer is now, dat er po man is ergwine
stracted wid hissef. I clare fore my blessed Marster
up yander if I had er node how butiful yer is
agwine ter look in dat black mourning, I wuld er
swaded yer to dun und dun it fore ole marsa died."
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
And what is going to become of Clarissa and Ned?
The mildew of age is upon them both. For years
past their old heads have been whitening with the
hoar frost. "Now ole marsa is dun und gon, de
fambly is ergwine to break up und de grate house
is agwine to be the home of de owls, und de swallers
und de bull-bats." So thought Clarissa as in the quiet
gloaming she stood in the verandah, and listened
to the melancholy winds and the more melancholy
bleating of the cattle. Ned had been doing little
chores about the house all the day, and after he
had eaten his supper, he and Clarissa had by permission
assembled in the dining-room where they
found their young mistress engaged in some light
needle work. She of course welcomed the negroes
heartily. They were her friends and had been
through many sore trials.</p>

<p>Clarissa was the first to break the silence, as she
enquired of her young mistress the day of the
month.</p>

<p>"It is the 27th day of September replied Alice."</p>

<p>"Ugh! Ugh! I tole yer so Ned. Aint nex mont
October?" she asked again.</p>

<p>"Yes, why do you ask?" replied Alice.</p>

<p>"Kase Ned sed the jedge warnt agwine to cum
no mo twell juvember. Ned is flustrated monstrus,
Miss Alice. So skeered de jedge is ergwine to tak
yer away frum me und him."</p>

<p>"And if he does, I am sure you will both be very
glad," Alice replied.</p>

<p>"Dat mout be so, yung mistress ef me und Clarsy
wus peerter und cud fend fur deyselves. But
bofe uv us is mity cranksided now er days, und de
Lord in Heaben only nose whar we'se agwine to
git ary moufful ob wittles when yu is dun und gon
to de tother eend ov de yearth. Me und Clarsy
slaved fur ole marsa fore de bellyun fell, und we
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
aint got no ole marsa to look bak to now, und we
puts our pendence in yu yung mistress."</p>

<p>"If I go away, Uncle Ned," replied Alice, "you
and Clarissa shall never suffer as long as I live."</p>

<p>"Ugh! Ugh! now yer got de wurd," exclaimed
Clarissa in tears.</p>

<p>"I haint er mistrusting yu Miss Alice," Ned answered,
quite dejectedly, as he raised his old coat
sleeve to his face, "but when yer is dun und gon
clean away how is yer eber agwine to git to us, ef
me er Clarissy mout need ye? Dar is de pint right
dar, misses. Ef I hes er bad miserry in my head,
und calls fur Miss Alice she cums lak er butterfly
und lays her soft hands on my po head und de
missery stops rite short; und ef I hankers arter er
chiken it is de same fing. Ef yer duz go erway,
misses, old Ned will follow yer with his shaky
jints twill yer gits clean, clar outen site, und pray
ebery day de Lord sens, dat yer mout be ez happy
as de angels."</p>

<p>It was Alice's turn as a matter of conceit to ask
the old negro what he thought of Judge Livingstone?</p>

<p>"Dat is a pinted questun," Ned answered hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"You mout ax me ef he was er suple man
und dat wudn't be a pinted questun, but yung
missis I'm bleeged to mistrust dese furreners dat
cums down here und spreads deyselves all
ober de lan, und fetches freedum und de horg
colery, und plays ruination wid our white fokses,
und den runs clean clar away wid our white gals,
upsotting de whole creashun wid dey flamborgasted
fixments. You mout be happy way off yander to de
tuther eend ob de yearth, den agin you mouten.
Yer can't tell misses how fur de bull-frog is ergwine
ter jump by lookin at his mouf."</p>

<p>To the foregoing argument Clarissa was assenting
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
by repeated nods of the head, ejaculating occasionally
"Ugh! Ugh! dats de gospel trufe."</p>

<p>"But Uncle Ned," enquired Alice, "would you
have me as your friend, a poor lonely girl to remain
at Ingleside without protection? Why don't
you know I would be miserable?"</p>

<p>"Yer mout be miserabler dan yer is, misses.
Heep er times our white gals finks dey is er upsotting
de yearth by gittin jined to de furreners
when dey is er flinging de fat in de fire. Look at
dat white gal ober de medder. She run away wid
wun ob dese carpet-sackers, und she wus dat proud
dat she wud hold her nose ef de po white trash
breshed up agin her cote skeerts. Und where is
she now?"</p>

<p>"Ugh! Ugh!" ejaculated Clarissa. "Wid de
furrener in de penitenshur, und she ergwine to de
ole kommissary fur her rashuns. Don't yer see?"
exclaimed Clarissa.</p>

<p>"Now misses I aint er sensing yer wid nun ob
dis bad luck, und I aint er putting de jedge on er
ekality wid de furrener in de penitenshur, but yer
don't know misses what is ergwine to happen when
de rope is er roun yer neck, und de furrener has
got hold ob de tuther eend."</p>

<p>"Dat yer don't," exclaimed Clarissa, rocking to
and fro.</p>

<p>"Und yer don't know missis whar me und Clarissa
is ergwine when dat ar jedge gits to be de
boss ob dis heer plantashun."</p>

<p>"Oh my Lord," shouted Clarissa as she burst
into tears. "Dats maks me ses wat I dos, yung
missis, dat yu axes me a pinted questun. Dats de
truf. It sho is."</p>

<p>Old Ned groaned as the gravity of the argument
seemed to affect him and brushed a tear from his
eye with the sleeve of his coat. The matter was
of momentous consequence to these old landmarks
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
of a decayed civilization, and they felt it
acutely. Old Master as long as he lived had held
out the lighted candle to light up the dreary, tortuous
paths into which reconstruction was driving
the old negroes; but the flame had died down into
cold ashes, and the hand that held it aloft was
nerveless and dead. There came as it were to their
old hearts a sad, sad refrain&mdash;"Breaking up! breaking
up!" It came from the winds that moaned in
and out of broken window shutters. It came from
the feathered songsters, Prima Donnas of the
air, who were sending forth their advance agents
to secure homes in Southern climes. "Breaking
up! breaking up!" Between such as these and
their former masters were there not higher and
holier feelings and relations than those of master
and servant? Without them the South would have
been the mere appurtenance of the commercial
North, dragging after it the weary chain of colonial
dependence. What a wilderness of wealth
they brought to our firesides, what a teeming aggregation
of populous and powerful states! Let
us at least give these old slaves one look of kindness
in the desolate twilight of their lingering
days.</p>

<p>The old negroes bade their young mistress a
hearty good night. "May de angels shelter yer dis
nite und all tuther nites wid dere whings, missis,"
exclaimed Ned as he followed Clarissa out of the
door. It was the saddest of all anticipations.
They loved Alice as if she were the apple of the
eye&mdash;the heart's core. Their sufferings and privations,
their joys and happiness in common, had
touched as it were the two extremes of the varied
horizon of life. And now they were advancing toward
the parting of the ways. Ned and Clarissa,
with unsteady, faltering footsteps toward the sunset,
the gloaming, the end of life; the young mistress
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
toward the sunrise, never so resplendent as
now.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Judge Livingstone, with his clerical friend from
the North, arrived at the appointed time at Ingleside;
he a bachelor of thirty-five, to wed this beautiful
heiress, the exquisite flower that had budded
and bloomed like a rose for twenty-six seasons.
Arrived to lacerate the old slavish hearts, that clung
so helplessly to the young mistress, like morning
glories around the fair flower. Arrived to snatch
from Ingleside so rudely its life, its hope, its
promise&mdash;the all in all to poor Clarissa and old
Ned. "Eben ole Jube knows dat sumfing solemkolly
is ergwine to happin," observed Clarissa to
her young mistress, as she assisted the bride in
her adornments for the nuptial hour. "Jess look
at dat ole fafeful dorg a lyin dare jess a strugglin
wid his moshuns, lak he was a humans sho nuff."</p>

<p>The minister stood at the little altar in the parlor.
The ring that Alice had given to "Arthur"
was slipped upon her finger, and in the presence
of the angels, Judge Livingstone and Alice were
made man and wife. As Ned and Clarissa passed
out of the little verandah, Ned observed with
streaming eyes, "Now Clarsy, dere is no mo music
fur us but de crickets upon de hath. Miss Alice
has dun und sung her las hime und we kaint foller
Miss Alice whar she is ergwine no mo. Ef we
uns is tuk sick we kaint holler fur Miss Alice no
mo. I feels lak I haint got no frend now. Miss
Alice dun jined hersef to dat furriner."</p>

<p>"Dat is Gords truf Ned," exclaimed Clarissa as
she drew her old checked apron across her eyes,
"Hit pears lak dere is nuffin in dis wurrel epseps
tribulashun of sperits. But bress her dear heart,"
the old negro continued, "I hope she may be jes es
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
happy es de larks down in de medder, und dat
when she arrivs way ober yander whar she is er
gwine she will send her membrunces to me und yu
fortwid."</p>

<p>It was necessary that Ingleside should be placed
in first class order. Above all things else it was
necessary that ample provision should be made for
Clarissa and Ned. These arrangements in minutest
detail were satisfactorily made, as the Judge observed
to his bride one morning after the wedding,
"Do you not grieve to part from your old friends,
my dear?"</p>

<p>Tears came into the sweet girl's eyes as she replied
so tenderly, "Yes, yes, they cling so helplessly
to me, but dear Arthur, you will not forget
them, will you?"</p>
